end to end cybersecurity aspect
of managed service, how the

0fe98365-3ddf-47fd-b18f-57cd920eb802-2
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.186
cyber security aspect of various
kinds of threat will be there,

0fe98365-3ddf-47fd-b18f-57cd920eb802-3
00:25:40.186 --> 00:25:44.488
how will take care of those
threats? What if there will be

0fe98365-3ddf-47fd-b18f-57cd920eb802-4
00:25:44.488 --> 00:25:44.780

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.595
Ransomware attack. How will take
care of those things? We have a

28efa25b-57e2-4186-b5b4-b99eacce1337-1
00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:53.178
uh program running called
hackme. So before Hacker hacks

28efa25b-57e2-4186-b5b4-b99eacce1337-2
00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:57.012
you, you hack yourself and know
what are the things that you

28efa25b-57e2-4186-b5b4-b99eacce1337-3
00:25:57.012 --> 00:26:00.908
need to do to protect yourself
and your company. So these are

28efa25b-57e2-4186-b5b4-b99eacce1337-4
00:26:00.908 --> 00:26:04.680
the couple of things that we are
working on it over to our.

28b962f1-9b70-4573-90c4-996a7372a27a-0
00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.729
Thank you, Sir. In terms of some
of the challenges, uh, which you

28b962f1-9b70-4573-90c4-996a7372a27a-1
00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:13.297
have seen because you had worked
with NCI PC in the past, right

28b962f1-9b70-4573-90c4-996a7372a27a-2
00:26:13.297 --> 00:26:13.520
now?

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-0
00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.355
Healthcare was not a critical
infrastructure and now it's been

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-1
00:26:18.355 --> 00:26:21.969
turned into a critical
infrastructure. So what are some

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-2
00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:25.970
of the changes that you will see
primarily for the healthcare

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-3
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:29.584
sector, you know would would we
expect some kind of new

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-4
00:26:29.584 --> 00:26:33.392
regulation to come out or
whatever. So this is a very, you

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-5
00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:37.264
have very rightly told I was
going through a report. In the

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-6
00:26:37.264 --> 00:26:40.943
report I find out that if a
healthcare system is getting

b8d050ef-f86d-4e10-b4a0-4b1c36742902-7
00:26:40.943 --> 00:26:44.879
attacked then the percent will
be deprived of its treatment.

180dc97e-8510-49b2-a901-49299d88ebdc-0
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.470
For almost 19 days.

772b07e2-0d50-4195-9adc-bfa74a7bd227-0
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.696
One or other form. So that is
the kind of uh digitization is

772b07e2-0d50-4195-9adc-bfa74a7bd227-1
00:26:52.696 --> 00:26:58.233
happening and the kind of things
that will impact and if you see

772b07e2-0d50-4195-9adc-bfa74a7bd227-2
00:26:58.233 --> 00:27:03.430
uh it has been increased for the
last year by 74 percentage.

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-0
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.050
And currently what we are
finding 14163 attacks are

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-1
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:12.372
happening per week which is
getting a lot of momentum that

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-2
00:27:12.372 --> 00:27:16.402
healthcare industry need to be
taken care. When we say

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-3
00:27:16.402 --> 00:27:20.798
healthcare industry basically we
are following the standard

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-4
00:27:20.798 --> 00:27:25.121
called published by HIPAA and
those American standard is a

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-5
00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:29.444
very good standard and we are
following it and this is how

7f4ed2ca-7ba8-408e-899e-d58ed558430f-6
00:27:29.444 --> 00:27:30.909
actually we have to.

23929159-6ae8-4f11-b8d4-2fba0eb5c5aa-0
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.024
Uh, customized in terms of
Indian requirements and the

23929159-6ae8-4f11-b8d4-2fba0eb5c5aa-1
00:27:36.024 --> 00:27:40.244
Indian requirements, you will
find out we have uh recently we

23929159-6ae8-4f11-b8d4-2fba0eb5c5aa-2
00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:43.784
have seen couple of attacks
happening in the Indian

23929159-6ae8-4f11-b8d4-2fba0eb5c5aa-3
00:27:43.784 --> 00:27:47.801
scenario. So in this context you
will find out they're not

23929159-6ae8-4f11-b8d4-2fba0eb5c5aa-4
00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:50.319
attacking with a very
sophisticated.

db8228fb-4bd7-4852-a48a-a7ceaab7755e-0
00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.874
Cyber attacks what they are
doing, they are sending some

db8228fb-4bd7-4852-a48a-a7ceaab7755e-1
00:27:53.874 --> 00:27:54.900
kind of missing meds.

254391a8-bb27-4b5f-8d38-12d2e00648c9-0
00:27:55.590 --> 00:28:00.734
And they're targeting some kind
of weak links where actually if

254391a8-bb27-4b5f-8d38-12d2e00648c9-1
00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:05.638
they will click that links then
the ransomware will just sit

254391a8-bb27-4b5f-8d38-12d2e00648c9-2
00:28:05.638 --> 00:28:06.040
down.

fb02e9ec-1971-4c87-a75d-268377c924ca-0
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.376
And it will not create any kind
of its action. So that means

fb02e9ec-1971-4c87-a75d-268377c924ca-1
00:28:11.376 --> 00:28:15.900
when the EXE file will be there,
the EXE file will not get

fb02e9ec-1971-4c87-a75d-268377c924ca-2
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.576
executed immediately. So what is
happening the EXE file will

fb02e9ec-1971-4c87-a75d-268377c924ca-3
00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:22.340
throw another exe file.

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-0
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:27.038
The moment it will throw another
EXE file and that will get

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-1
00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:31.139
activated based on the attacker
which has been programmed and

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-2
00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:35.107
which has been taken the time.
So in that. Many people will

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-3
00:28:35.107 --> 00:28:39.208
lose that they are not able to
track what is going. They will

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-4
00:28:39.208 --> 00:28:43.176
say oh I have a downloaded a
link which is a very good link

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-5
00:28:43.176 --> 00:28:47.343
and nothing has happened. But
that link creates a EXE file and

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-6
00:28:47.343 --> 00:28:51.113
that EXE file will create
another EXE file and that will

8c2cf2a5-6fd6-45b2-9a6a-a22adaeffe2b-7
00:28:51.113 --> 00:28:53.230
in the back end it will execute.

85747538-c9e0-45da-aa9a-75a6aef8c12c-0
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.703
The moment it will be executed
it will create a lot of hard

85747538-c9e0-45da-aa9a-75a6aef8c12c-1
00:28:57.703 --> 00:29:01.640
work regarding. You have rightly
told we need to have new

85747538-c9e0-45da-aa9a-75a6aef8c12c-2
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.559
legislation should be brought in
terms of.

81f5192f-4f19-4415-8e54-4ef27b2ad9d0-0
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.767
I mean in the medical sector,
because uh, we are our, uh,

81f5192f-4f19-4415-8e54-4ef27b2ad9d0-1
00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:14.157
Digital Privacy Act is coming.
So I hope I have not gone

81f5192f-4f19-4415-8e54-4ef27b2ad9d0-2
00:29:14.157 --> 00:29:18.855
through it. Maybe they have
covered the healthcare aspect of

81f5192f-4f19-4415-8e54-4ef27b2ad9d0-3
00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:19.780
some extent.

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-0
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.803
But it is very essential to
consider considering the UK

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-1
00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:29.502
scenario. Considering the US
scenario where actually a lot of

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-2
00:29:29.502 --> 00:29:34.428
attacks has been happened, it is
very much essential to find out

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-3
00:29:34.428 --> 00:29:39.126
a new legislation and that new
legislation should be up India

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-4
00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:43.901
specific because why I say India
specific, the reason being is

6682e416-d52e-4323-80f3-bbb811e6b8a6-5
00:29:43.901 --> 00:29:44.280
that.

3d15cdc1-380d-44d5-a022-c06603594a09-0
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:49.953
We are not 100% digital. We are
in the midst of going for

3d15cdc1-380d-44d5-a022-c06603594a09-1
00:29:49.953 --> 00:29:54.932
digitization. So that means when
you transition there is a

3d15cdc1-380d-44d5-a022-c06603594a09-2
00:29:54.932 --> 00:30:00.079
probability of attack is very
often will happen. So that way

3d15cdc1-380d-44d5-a022-c06603594a09-3
00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:02.020
it will be half summit.

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-0
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.325
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor Abu
uh I'll uh let uh, Terence, uh

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-1
00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:09.713
come in here. Terence is the
head for cybersecurity business

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-2
00:30:09.713 --> 00:30:13.157
and national security officer
for Microsoft. Welcome Terrence

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-3
00:30:13.157 --> 00:30:16.546
and thank you for finding time.
You know, Microsoft has been

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-4
00:30:16.546 --> 00:30:19.990
doing some significant amount of
work securing the healthcare

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-5
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.379
sector and we did get a chance
to some of the findings which

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-6
00:30:23.379 --> 00:30:26.934
have been shared in the past. So
you know, over to you tenants.

fddd4c06-654f-4cb2-91fd-ab326ff3449a-7
00:30:26.934 --> 00:30:27.490
Thank you.

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-0
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.452
Thank you. Thank you, Manish and
again good evening to my

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-1
00:30:32.452 --> 00:30:36.218
esteemed guest speakers and
people who have joined both in

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-2
00:30:36.218 --> 00:30:39.921
person and online, it's a
privilege to spend and share my

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-3
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:43.687
thoughts as well as you know,
your your thoughts and learn

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-4
00:30:43.687 --> 00:30:47.645
together. As I share my point of
view, I thought you know, to

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-5
00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:51.284
also make sure that I can
present it so that you can see

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-6
00:30:51.284 --> 00:30:55.178
what I'm actually trying to
articulate and share with you. I

743c27f0-6c13-41ce-b6a6-63d3e16b2872-7
00:30:55.178 --> 00:30:59.199
don't have many slides, I just
thought I'll use one or two to.

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-0
00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.258
Navigate the conversation uh and
and make sure that you know I

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-1
00:31:03.258 --> 00:31:07.095
can be followed online. So when
we were at Microsoft as you know

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-2
00:31:07.095 --> 00:31:10.813
like the the Microsoft Digital
crimes Unit, this is a division

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-3
00:31:10.813 --> 00:31:13.883
that has been put in place
predominantly to look at

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-4
00:31:13.883 --> 00:31:17.129
cybersecurity you know and
protect I would say for the

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-5
00:31:17.129 --> 00:31:20.434
larger good and this is where a
lot of threat analysis,

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-6
00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:24.035
intelligence and threat sharing
works across both public and

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-7
00:31:24.035 --> 00:31:27.753
private sector space when you're
looking at healthcare and the

878126b4-249d-417d-a423-8d9fd3416c9b-8
00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:30.410
trends that are happening in the
healthcare.

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-0
00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.161
Notice these six, uh that are
actually quite evident in the

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-1
00:31:34.161 --> 00:31:37.933
last few months and as as I've
also mentioned right, phishing

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-2
00:31:37.933 --> 00:31:41.767
is a growing challenge. I didn't
bring up speak about fishing,

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-3
00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:45.600
but definitely fishing is also
growing challenge. We just call

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-4
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.373
out some of the key things that
are you know that are I would

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-5
00:31:49.373 --> 00:31:52.903
say targeting this industry.
Ransomware definitely is the

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-6
00:31:52.903 --> 00:31:56.614
number one issue that we are
seeing here and and we all know

587705da-0e27-468f-a9dc-8f15b0848ea4-7
00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:59.840
that we've heard about certain
healthcare providers.

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-0
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:03.990
Who were locked out and were
unable to provide patient care

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-1
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.296
and were held at ransom.
Attackers are really looking at

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-2
00:32:07.296 --> 00:32:10.892
ways to leverage this to their
advantage and and put that you

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-3
00:32:10.892 --> 00:32:14.430
know in fact they don't even
hesitate putting patients lives

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-4
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.200
at risk and that's a serious and
so on. The second thing that we

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-5
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.506
are also seeing is the connected
medical devices and the

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-6
00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:25.276
vulnerabilities that they bring
in. That's another thing that we

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-7
00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:28.814
you know we are seeing which
needs to be also put into place

a2849072-b6c9-4192-9526-aeb5c4f0edb4-8
00:32:28.814 --> 00:32:31.250
when we're thinking about cyber
security.

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-0
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.893
And and what all should the
scope of a cyber security

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-1
00:32:34.893 --> 00:32:38.840
framework look like in that of
course data breaches around the

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-2
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.662
rise. We know patient data, PII
data is something that is of

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-3
00:32:42.662 --> 00:32:46.359
interest to the underground
criminals and they are looking

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-4
00:32:46.359 --> 00:32:50.056
at ways to monetize that. So
this industry is continues to

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-5
00:32:50.056 --> 00:32:54.066
see that threat and we also see
some rise of the insider threat

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-6
00:32:54.066 --> 00:32:57.951
where either accidentally or
intentionally internal employees

ea41b823-b7c5-40b5-aec5-176ffe0af65d-7
00:32:57.951 --> 00:33:01.459
sometimes go rogue and and lead
to data compromise and.

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-0
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:05.768
Cyber compromises. The other
thing that we also are seeing is

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-1
00:33:05.768 --> 00:33:09.528
yes, we speak about BYOD, we
speak about mobile device

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-2
00:33:09.528 --> 00:33:13.699
security, but specifically in
this sector in a mobile device

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-3
00:33:13.699 --> 00:33:17.869
security, something that still
has some work to do. We still

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-4
00:33:17.869 --> 00:33:21.971
see health data, patient data
access being given to the the

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-5
00:33:21.971 --> 00:33:26.005
the entire Community or the
supply chain that forms a part

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-6
00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:30.175
of the health sector. And many a
times you may not have full

467ab540-572f-4e21-8952-7f1165f40669-7
00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:32.089
control on the supply chain.

af844a13-92c2-4cdf-aac5-baf9d1dbd6d5-0
00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.444
All the third party providers
that are part of the healthcare

af844a13-92c2-4cdf-aac5-baf9d1dbd6d5-1
00:33:36.444 --> 00:33:40.237
network, especially third party
contractors or outsourced

af844a13-92c2-4cdf-aac5-baf9d1dbd6d5-2
00:33:40.237 --> 00:33:44.030
organizations. So I think when
we're looking at security.

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-0
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:48.294
And when we're, you know, kind
of debating on what, what should

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-1
00:33:48.294 --> 00:33:51.186
be the way forward. I think
these are also some of the

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-2
00:33:51.186 --> 00:33:54.550
points I thought I'll lay on the
table for us to deliberate and

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-3
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.915
and think about as we look at,
you know, what should the future

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-4
00:33:57.915 --> 00:34:00.754
look like when it comes to
security in the healthcare

b7c9f6a4-73e5-45ba-a268-57eac911ad69-5
00:34:00.754 --> 00:34:01.070
space.

4a6a76d7-303a-41f9-b7fa-0b55ab1c4cb5-0
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.270
Back to you. Thank you.

6262f52e-7acd-42df-b7dc-23077c83c97a-0
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.380
Thanks uh Terrence.

7211bb90-fc61-4ea9-aa15-a78c01924b97-0
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:13.400
Garima Smita, you have got any
anything that you want to add?

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-0
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.683
Hi, Ganesh. No, I think since
I'm representing Microsoft,

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-1
00:34:18.683 --> 00:34:22.003
Terrance already spoke. So I'll
come in later if I have an

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-2
00:34:22.003 --> 00:34:25.491
incremental. Thanks. So I'll,
I'll thanks. I'll bring in Amit

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-3
00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:28.924
Dubey, he's a well renowned
cyber security expert and he saw

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-4
00:34:28.924 --> 00:34:32.131
a lot of cyber crime which
impacts healthcare as well as

50eadcc6-e32a-4bbc-b25f-abd24e49409f-5
00:34:32.131 --> 00:34:35.620
other critical infrastructure.
You know he's solved multiple.

c64e14f2-0733-48bd-ae9c-4a6a11ed8736-0
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.031
Crime investigations, which
include ransomware attacks and

c64e14f2-0733-48bd-ae9c-4a6a11ed8736-1
00:34:40.031 --> 00:34:43.326
his work closely with NCIC
earlier. Yeah, Amit, over to

c64e14f2-0733-48bd-ae9c-4a6a11ed8736-2
00:34:43.326 --> 00:34:45.150
you. Thanks. Thank you, ganish.

c4465861-1cf7-4973-bf58-2b9578941634-0
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:50.182
And I think this is the most
sensitive area for cyber

c4465861-1cf7-4973-bf58-2b9578941634-1
00:34:50.182 --> 00:34:54.600
security, a part of the defense
I think Healthcare is uh.

bbe37140-86be-42cb-b007-430b07dbe14b-0
00:34:55.590 --> 00:35:00.126
Uh, the mostly targeted sector
uh that we have seen in last one

bbe37140-86be-42cb-b007-430b07dbe14b-1
00:35:00.126 --> 00:35:04.096
year, we have uh also lost lots
of revenue trust across

bbe37140-86be-42cb-b007-430b07dbe14b-2
00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:08.633
healthcare sector and such kind
of initiations to include it in

bbe37140-86be-42cb-b007-430b07dbe14b-3
00:35:08.633 --> 00:35:10.759
critical infrastructure or to.

57858ca2-2816-41bd-9cba-053509b09920-0
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.823
Create a spatial framework for
healthcare. Security framework

57858ca2-2816-41bd-9cba-053509b09920-1
00:35:14.823 --> 00:35:16.780
for Healthcare is the need of
the hour.

2fe7bde0-8b21-4a49-8ab7-0c6a55edaa3b-0
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.279
I was partially part of the AMS
investigation. I was part of

2fe7bde0-8b21-4a49-8ab7-0c6a55edaa3b-1
00:35:22.279 --> 00:35:26.468
many other such recent attacks
investigation. So I I have my

2fe7bde0-8b21-4a49-8ab7-0c6a55edaa3b-2
00:35:26.468 --> 00:35:30.589
own learning that how all these
attacks originated and from

2fe7bde0-8b21-4a49-8ab7-0c6a55edaa3b-3
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:34.778
where they were originated and
we could attribute it to to a

2fe7bde0-8b21-4a49-8ab7-0c6a55edaa3b-4
00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:37.799
great extent to the state
sponsored bodies.

56f6ad44-3c1d-4ca8-ab53-0a916e319d19-0
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:43.236
And that shows that uh, the
there is no dearth of uh sort of

56f6ad44-3c1d-4ca8-ab53-0a916e319d19-1
00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:47.340
a tools and technologies
available with these actors.

b80392db-247e-43fb-9f33-a13e1f0f8783-0
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.270
And that's why a sector which is
so vulnerable otherwise.

211fd288-efcf-474a-bf22-94c2a52457f7-0
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.398
In Ames case, basically we have
seen that it was uh, it was

211fd288-efcf-474a-bf22-94c2a52457f7-1
00:35:55.398 --> 00:35:57.400
following the regular audit
processes.

fe3edfbb-844a-4f42-a16d-34931f656bf5-0
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.084
Uh, they had a right audit just
three months back. They had a

fe3edfbb-844a-4f42-a16d-34931f656bf5-1
00:36:02.084 --> 00:36:04.860
report and despite of that, it
has happened.

17f7c4c1-d853-4598-9178-9f3be28178e6-0
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:09.056
And you identified few
vulnerabilities though in the

17f7c4c1-d853-4598-9178-9f3be28178e6-1
00:36:09.056 --> 00:36:12.280
system, but there were multiple
factors, so we cannot.

8a164bf0-1eea-4945-b942-ef54586e693e-0
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.704
We cannot make any one such
factor responsible for this

8a164bf0-1eea-4945-b942-ef54586e693e-1
00:36:16.704 --> 00:36:19.904
entire attack because there were
multiple things and that that

8a164bf0-1eea-4945-b942-ef54586e693e-2
00:36:19.904 --> 00:36:21.530
shows that that itself say that.

e3ec72b6-3e5a-404e-a58f-02fad4611c81-0
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.643
Whoever was actually planning
this, they they they were

e3ec72b6-3e5a-404e-a58f-02fad4611c81-1
00:36:25.643 --> 00:36:27.610
actually trying it through
multiple channels.

87673f16-4a6d-43c4-9e1a-40fc96f1c2c8-0
00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.624
They faced a similar attacks few
months back. They lost some

87673f16-4a6d-43c4-9e1a-40fc96f1c2c8-1
00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:34.860
data. At that time they didn't
realize, but then eventually the

87673f16-4a6d-43c4-9e1a-40fc96f1c2c8-2
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.580
current somewhere was
successful.

4113abf1-5d9e-423d-9ed8-c2bbf1bd0e1f-0
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.423
And the 41357 vulnerabilities of
e-mail or any other such

4113abf1-5d9e-423d-9ed8-c2bbf1bd0e1f-1
00:36:41.423 --> 00:36:44.886
vulnerability which was
exploited. This was not fixed in

4113abf1-5d9e-423d-9ed8-c2bbf1bd0e1f-2
00:36:44.886 --> 00:36:45.190
time.

a8274a96-9e34-4a6c-8169-43e531561432-0
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.390
So if I could extend beyond
what?

48cef811-785e-4cad-ba9c-2bfc2fb0c7b2-0
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.030
We have just heard from the
expert.

ae363a51-41ea-4bcf-88fc-c80dd626b46e-0
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.229
Regular patching is definitely a
big big issue which I have

ae363a51-41ea-4bcf-88fc-c80dd626b46e-1
00:36:59.229 --> 00:37:03.517
observed in most of these cases.
Uh, the softwares are not

ae363a51-41ea-4bcf-88fc-c80dd626b46e-2
00:37:03.517 --> 00:37:07.949
updated, especially the emails
servers and the VPNs. And the

ae363a51-41ea-4bcf-88fc-c80dd626b46e-3
00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:11.800
other thing is we need a
continuous auditing process

ae363a51-41ea-4bcf-88fc-c80dd626b46e-4
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.600
instead of.

bcd4403d-8f1f-4efa-abf1-fa6ae99bb820-0
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:14.980
By.

81d70f30-f77e-4f57-8d2b-c48fe543d2df-0
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.243
But you're like having uh
monthly or or or quarterly or

81d70f30-f77e-4f57-8d2b-c48fe543d2df-1
00:37:19.243 --> 00:37:22.567
even having two audits in a year
will not be sufficient

81d70f30-f77e-4f57-8d2b-c48fe543d2df-2
00:37:22.567 --> 00:37:26.484
especially for healthcare sector
because it is a very dynamic and

81d70f30-f77e-4f57-8d2b-c48fe543d2df-3
00:37:26.484 --> 00:37:28.680
new kind of devices keeps on
adding.

9b34c4bb-7ce8-425a-b2c9-b4b85da797de-0
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:33.103
I also suggest one, if possible,
to generate a framework which

9b34c4bb-7ce8-425a-b2c9-b4b85da797de-1
00:37:33.103 --> 00:37:36.020
could be blockchain based
configuration management.

f4fb3151-1334-4aac-8537-db69a43aaa33-0
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.012
Why it is so? Because we have
seen people are changing

f4fb3151-1334-4aac-8537-db69a43aaa33-1
00:37:40.012 --> 00:37:42.860
configurations of many of these
servers frequently.

655e84a6-81d0-48be-ba6c-64a8ca799ea8-0
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.840
And if we could restrict that.

c12a123a-87d2-4457-8a18-eebbb5cabc1d-0
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.370
Or we could uh.

26e54b5c-d2ef-4a8f-b04e-708461eb83f6-0
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.470
Create a system back end system
which could.

bfa3a22e-37d0-42d5-bd16-5f3af93cbf24-0
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:58.564
Be self learning that OK, this
system cannot be manipulated.

bfa3a22e-37d0-42d5-bd16-5f3af93cbf24-1
00:37:58.564 --> 00:38:02.263
This configuration cannot be
changed because of a back end

bfa3a22e-37d0-42d5-bd16-5f3af93cbf24-2
00:38:02.263 --> 00:38:05.210
blockchain which is managing all
these things.

5a80ac87-14b2-4e3c-9d8b-7742adf860fa-0
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.656
I think that will help and that
is not only for healthcare

5a80ac87-14b2-4e3c-9d8b-7742adf860fa-1
00:38:08.656 --> 00:38:11.395
sector. This is this. This is
applicable for any other sector

5a80ac87-14b2-4e3c-9d8b-7742adf860fa-2
00:38:11.395 --> 00:38:13.870
where we have not utilized yet
the power of blockchain.

e26b33c2-f6c8-43aa-88f2-02f7620aaf2b-0
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.471
And this is something which
later on when we do as a root

e26b33c2-f6c8-43aa-88f2-02f7620aaf2b-1
00:38:17.471 --> 00:38:20.533
cause analysis, we realized
there were multiple people those

e26b33c2-f6c8-43aa-88f2-02f7620aaf2b-2
00:38:20.533 --> 00:38:22.842
were changing these
configurations. They were

e26b33c2-f6c8-43aa-88f2-02f7620aaf2b-3
00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:25.351
playing with those
configurations because of many

e26b33c2-f6c8-43aa-88f2-02f7620aaf2b-4
00:38:25.351 --> 00:38:27.410
reasons, because they receive a
request.

4d20402c-5ca3-48b5-a0aa-7ec1c233acea-0
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.283
This would have come through and
spoof e-mail or this would have

4d20402c-5ca3-48b5-a0aa-7ec1c233acea-1
00:38:32.283 --> 00:38:35.827
come from an authentic e-mail,
doesn't matter but any such

4d20402c-5ca3-48b5-a0aa-7ec1c233acea-2
00:38:35.827 --> 00:38:38.290
firewall disabling or making it
lenient.

03acb270-2cd5-444d-86bf-61090803dede-0
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:43.616
Can result to any such attempt.
Uh, attack uh very soon, so it

03acb270-2cd5-444d-86bf-61090803dede-1
00:38:43.616 --> 00:38:44.180
happens.

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-0
00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.012
You said rightly Sir that
ransomware is #1, but ransomware

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-1
00:38:49.012 --> 00:38:52.830
is also becoming sophisticated
now. So whatever technologies

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-2
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.459
that we had to stop ransomware
now it is not working. And

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-3
00:38:56.459 --> 00:39:00.402
that's why I think we need much
more sophisticated backup data

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-4
00:39:00.402 --> 00:39:04.032
plans. I was not bothered
because of this attack happened

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-5
00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:07.850
on healthcare. I was much more
bothered because we could not

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-6
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.041
recover from it soon. So
incident response was not

cc21db68-2165-4e08-949c-201bc9927713-7
00:39:11.041 --> 00:39:11.480
proper.

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-0
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.900
See, we cannot guarantee that
the attacks will not happen or

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-1
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.751
or we can stop any such attack
instantly. No, it it won't this,

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-2
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:23.181
this kind of expectation is, I
think, not normal. We can

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-3
00:39:23.181 --> 00:39:26.912
recover quickly. We should have
a provision, we should have a

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-4
00:39:26.912 --> 00:39:30.642
proper IR mechanism in place so
that just like NHS, when they

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-5
00:39:30.642 --> 00:39:34.132
had one 1A cry and they could
recover soon, within two to

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-6
00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:37.743
three days, I think aims took
close to 12 to 13 days, which

d3839258-217f-4896-a067-379eee46a92a-7
00:39:37.743 --> 00:39:40.090
was too much for an healthcare
sector.

7c4b27c8-38dd-4c21-8b56-8ae64c1ee0b4-0
00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.034
So we should have a provision,
proper provision for IR where we

7c4b27c8-38dd-4c21-8b56-8ae64c1ee0b4-1
00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:47.197
could recover within an hour or
two hours or three hours at Max.

7c4b27c8-38dd-4c21-8b56-8ae64c1ee0b4-2
00:39:47.197 --> 00:39:50.263
I think that is something which
we should plan and if we could

7c4b27c8-38dd-4c21-8b56-8ae64c1ee0b4-3
00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:51.480
achieve that sort of SLA.

234414d3-493d-459c-927d-8ec755c855e9-0
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.450
That will itself. Uh Harris, the
attackers.

e7cbaa00-cee7-4044-96cc-8f48df359864-0
00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.097
So I think that is something
which which will go against them

e7cbaa00-cee7-4044-96cc-8f48df359864-1
00:40:00.097 --> 00:40:03.352
right now they are confident
that they can actually put this

e7cbaa00-cee7-4044-96cc-8f48df359864-2
00:40:03.352 --> 00:40:05.860
damage for a longer duration and
can actually.

66a7149c-d1d3-4605-929f-e76918e2729a-0
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.843
Result into a bigger losses in
many many ways, revenue wise or

66a7149c-d1d3-4605-929f-e76918e2729a-1
00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:15.713
reputation wise or maybe data
wise itself. So I think these

66a7149c-d1d3-4605-929f-e76918e2729a-2
00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:19.196
are the things which which I see
and I'm I'm strongly

66a7149c-d1d3-4605-929f-e76918e2729a-3
00:40:19.196 --> 00:40:23.324
recommending it to become a part
of the critical infrastructure

66a7149c-d1d3-4605-929f-e76918e2729a-4
00:40:23.324 --> 00:40:25.130
body of India and there are.

2ad35e3e-66f8-4c11-8922-7157471f0700-0
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:29.527
Few other processes that should
be required because most of

2ad35e3e-66f8-4c11-8922-7157471f0700-1
00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.730
these healthcare sensors and
devices.

625356f8-4562-4427-a2a8-9c4c69f6db35-0
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.760
They are being imported through
various countries.

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-0
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:39.248
They followed different
protocols and security is the

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-1
00:40:39.248 --> 00:40:43.173
last priority for most of them.
I'm referring mostly the

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-2
00:40:43.173 --> 00:40:47.236
diagnostic devices. So I was
doing an audit of one of such

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-3
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:51.231
hospital and realized that
because of these multiple kind

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-4
00:40:51.231 --> 00:40:55.225
of protocols they're not
integrated in a smoother way. So

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-5
00:40:55.225 --> 00:40:59.288
they are managing it through
different independent servers

356b9d67-c268-4abc-9cd5-69ba746e3672-6
00:40:59.288 --> 00:41:03.420
and that itself is a challenge
that because if you are not.

29b6c3b6-d394-4b04-94e7-6d5b659826f9-0
00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.048
Not actually following security
processes for each and every

29b6c3b6-d394-4b04-94e7-6d5b659826f9-1
00:41:09.048 --> 00:41:12.726
devices. Actually you are
creating loopholes and any such

29b6c3b6-d394-4b04-94e7-6d5b659826f9-2
00:41:12.726 --> 00:41:15.580
gap will result to damage the
entire system.

7f8c1ed6-02b5-429f-8c23-5ca1d919d14f-0
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:21.400
So I think we need lots of
effort to create.

7d2fbde9-080a-4619-81d9-3361aa257e2d-0
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:22.870
Uh.

93b842ed-5fb4-46ca-a1db-12b150a84f59-0
00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:26.814
The standards for healthcare
sectors for for, for protocols

93b842ed-5fb4-46ca-a1db-12b150a84f59-1
00:41:26.814 --> 00:41:30.112
and IoT sensors and and also
servers especially because they

93b842ed-5fb4-46ca-a1db-12b150a84f59-2
00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:33.572
they, they they have to manage
the real time data which is very

93b842ed-5fb4-46ca-a1db-12b150a84f59-3
00:41:33.572 --> 00:41:34.600
very sensitive and.

d1371e1d-0984-4aed-84cb-7188fab57504-0
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.985
I think this other kind of
provisions will not be

d1371e1d-0984-4aed-84cb-7188fab57504-1
00:41:38.985 --> 00:41:41.853
applicable here. So these are
few my objective few of my

d1371e1d-0984-4aed-84cb-7188fab57504-2
00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:44.570
observations that I have seen in
recent such attacks.

a6e7410a-957b-4177-b1af-006b6f7c3444-0
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:48.958
Yes, there were threats due to
insiders. Also we received lots

a6e7410a-957b-4177-b1af-006b6f7c3444-1
00:41:48.958 --> 00:41:52.421
of such complaints from many
such companies to they do not

a6e7410a-957b-4177-b1af-006b6f7c3444-2
00:41:52.421 --> 00:41:56.237
want to reveal about ransomware
attacks. But but then we realize

a6e7410a-957b-4177-b1af-006b6f7c3444-3
00:41:56.237 --> 00:41:57.470
that 50% of the time.

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-0
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.192
It is a job of insider as well.
So ransomware as a service is

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-1
00:42:02.192 --> 00:42:06.045
also coming in a big way uh, the
Black Hat the the the the the

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-2
00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:09.776
group from Russia they were
offering it as a ransomware as a

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-3
00:42:09.776 --> 00:42:13.629
service and we also learned that
they were they were they were

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-4
00:42:13.629 --> 00:42:17.543
they were offering a service and
in in in revenue sharing model

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-5
00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:21.396
7030 or 8020 like whatever we'll
collect we'll pass it to you.

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-6
00:42:21.396 --> 00:42:24.882
And so the way they want to
reach out to these companies

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-7
00:42:24.882 --> 00:42:28.613
through Insiders insider will
make money. So I think this we

88e84793-7da5-4778-aafa-c8fca0aeb1c9-8
00:42:28.613 --> 00:42:29.470
need to learn.

56cd46c9-e3ed-4e45-8b9e-11941bb28f54-0
00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.528
That we need to somehow create
some processes to to check

56cd46c9-e3ed-4e45-8b9e-11941bb28f54-1
00:42:33.528 --> 00:42:37.842
integrity of people and to make
them more responsible about it.

56cd46c9-e3ed-4e45-8b9e-11941bb28f54-2
00:42:37.842 --> 00:42:41.010
Right now I think these
processes are missing.

38023ad0-3c96-486d-b837-811f9ec95f9d-0
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.060
Thank you.

e6b0e11c-2854-4862-9191-84aad217ef25-0
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.720
So coming to a more basic
question, what could be the

e6b0e11c-2854-4862-9191-84aad217ef25-1
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.602
possible reasons why the
healthcare sector is one of the

e6b0e11c-2854-4862-9191-84aad217ef25-2
00:42:49.602 --> 00:42:50.310
most targeted?

509c5de0-8f0d-4d3e-b726-ed57e93aafe6-0
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:55.830
Who would like to answer? I
yeah, please.

c98386fe-c795-452a-a67c-c009bc7c9595-0
00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.840


6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-0
00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.583
Uh, in telecom sector, basically
I'm just giving analogy. If you

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-1
00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:23.860
see in the telecom sector, they
are basically going for a basic

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-2
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:28.004
hygiene test, what we call as a
MBS configuration in the MBS,

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-3
00:43:28.004 --> 00:43:31.813
minimum security baseline
standard need to be configured

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-4
00:43:31.813 --> 00:43:36.157
in all the equipments. And then
we do a VPT to find out what are

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-5
00:43:36.157 --> 00:43:40.233
the loopholes, how many ports
are open, how many unnecessary

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-6
00:43:40.233 --> 00:43:44.376
services are open, what are the
various services are running,

6142a131-163e-4af2-9afe-fdc6bd55c825-7
00:43:44.376 --> 00:43:47.049
what are the various kinds of
services.

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-0
00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:52.020
Catering to what extent to other
it's a catering to governments

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-1
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.910
PDF services or it is catering
to the public health. So we have

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-2
00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:01.571
to consider all these factor
into account. But when it comes

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-3
00:44:01.571 --> 00:44:06.461
to medical devices, most of the
medical devices are not scanned

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-4
00:44:06.461 --> 00:44:11.198
or they're not be PT. They have
been done on that devices and

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-5
00:44:11.198 --> 00:44:15.248
these devices are #1. These
devices are not down the

8d7112ef-03ec-433c-b18b-8e336f88c80b-6
00:44:15.248 --> 00:44:16.700
respective B scans.

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-0
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:21.913
That is number one. Second to is
there is a security policy need

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-1
00:44:21.913 --> 00:44:25.691
to be implemented and these
security policy once you

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-2
00:44:25.691 --> 00:44:29.683
implemented it has to be
percolated to different levels

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-3
00:44:29.683 --> 00:44:34.103
which has not been case in the
medical segments. So basically

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-4
00:44:34.103 --> 00:44:38.665
if we the security policy if we
see the have been a very robust

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-5
00:44:38.665 --> 00:44:42.800
security policy has been
designed in other sectors as you

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-6
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.792
rightly told that now it has
been the Healthcare is now

b3075ba2-1c4a-4f25-b6bb-1e7aef7cfa7d-7
00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:47.220
added.

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-0
00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:51.365
And the CIP, previously it was
not a critical infrastructure.

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-1
00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:55.440
So the policy which has been
drafted, if we see NCI PC's that

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-2
00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.515
need to be customized for the
healthcare system, it will take

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-3
00:44:59.515 --> 00:45:03.787
time. In the I'm giving example
of Indian scenario, it will take

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-4
00:45:03.787 --> 00:45:08.125
the time to configure those kind
of big hospital systems. It will

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-5
00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:12.003
not percolate to the users
immediately. And the third most

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-6
00:45:12.003 --> 00:45:16.209
important thing is you have to
create a user awareness program,

528b330f-2304-47cc-954e-cee6df0cd931-7
00:45:16.209 --> 00:45:17.130
so in medical.

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-0
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:21.467
Basically what will happen there
are so much of peoples are

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-1
00:45:21.467 --> 00:45:25.219
engaged in their daily
day-to-day life. So they cyber

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-2
00:45:25.219 --> 00:45:29.317
security take us after thought
rather than it is a bolt in

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-3
00:45:29.317 --> 00:45:33.763
process what we called as a it
is a built in process that means

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-4
00:45:33.763 --> 00:45:38.278
cybersecurity. They will say OK,
we'll see it in the letter, let

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-5
00:45:38.278 --> 00:45:42.655
the other critical services is
important for them. So that way

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-6
00:45:42.655 --> 00:45:46.336
actually you have to understand
since we are going a

3b340fbe-4744-46de-ad8f-c39dc9f86373-7
00:45:46.336 --> 00:45:47.239
digitization.

9d17cc09-54e8-408a-8937-89c3a24b7fd3-0
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.588
We are not or no more in the
same mode as we are operated in

9d17cc09-54e8-408a-8937-89c3a24b7fd3-1
00:45:51.588 --> 00:45:55.983
terms of like mechanical where
actually you can take some time.

9d17cc09-54e8-408a-8937-89c3a24b7fd3-2
00:45:55.983 --> 00:46:00.310
As Amija rightly told it will be
12 days to recover. Is it too

9d17cc09-54e8-408a-8937-89c3a24b7fd3-3
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:04.636
much? You should have a specific
incident response plan how it

9d17cc09-54e8-408a-8937-89c3a24b7fd3-4
00:46:04.636 --> 00:46:09.100
has been defined. It is normally
defined in the security policy.

1d67e716-9498-462d-b116-1a90cd34eb28-0
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:14.370
So that those kind of things at
least need to be known by the

1d67e716-9498-462d-b116-1a90cd34eb28-1
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:18.798
basically if you go to all the
hospitals, I have been done a

1d67e716-9498-462d-b116-1a90cd34eb28-2
00:46:18.798 --> 00:46:23.371
little bit of survey after this
incident this hospitals do not

1d67e716-9498-462d-b116-1a90cd34eb28-3
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:24.460
have a seizure.

a74f47e9-664f-45cb-90d4-95c8e2ea6324-0
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.060
They have an IT officers.

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-0
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:31.588
Information technology officers
which they look after all their

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-1
00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:34.495
networks. So you need a
dedicated sisso which will

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-2
00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:37.345
understand the network, which
will understand the

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-3
00:46:37.345 --> 00:46:40.424
applications, which will
understand where the servers

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-4
00:46:40.424 --> 00:46:43.958
have been placed, which will
understand what are the critical

503d3c1a-4ccc-4a7a-ba0d-74f953fe66c8-5
00:46:43.958 --> 00:46:47.550
presents data, where it is going
and where it is being stored.

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-0
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.990
And you will also understand as
Amidi rightly told, what are the

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-1
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.837
barriers, backup processes, how
frequently you are taking

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-2
00:46:56.837 --> 00:47:01.148
backup, your critical datas. So
all this that need to be changed

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-3
00:47:01.148 --> 00:47:04.995
then you will find out the
medical system, the robustness

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-4
00:47:04.995 --> 00:47:09.239
will come. That was the case in
2011, I will say in the telecom

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-5
00:47:09.239 --> 00:47:13.152
sector also in India, when
actually we started the telecom

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-6
00:47:13.152 --> 00:47:17.065
security new regulation. So
that's why I whatever connects

bff03531-427c-496c-bf9c-469735eeaf20-7
00:47:17.065 --> 00:47:18.790
told you need a dedicated.

b1f5b2d6-97ac-4613-933b-e2aa5d0109a6-0
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.310
Security.

7e7d86a5-b1e1-4baa-bcfb-e9109774df02-0
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.930
Regulation for telecom sectors,
so that will actually.

444afc8f-25ae-4903-80a3-a9ef8622da4e-0
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.642
One way or other way it will
once it will comes from

444afc8f-25ae-4903-80a3-a9ef8622da4e-1
00:47:28.642 --> 00:47:31.940
government, it will force to
implement by all the players.

19daf17a-bd76-4b2f-99b4-4dd684cccd4d-0
00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.520
Reason.

36766c11-d7e4-4c7b-bf93-9d45b7190d75-0
00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.244
For me, asking that question
was, does it mean that the

36766c11-d7e4-4c7b-bf93-9d45b7190d75-1
00:47:39.244 --> 00:47:42.159
healthcare sector was like a
sitting duck waiting to be

36766c11-d7e4-4c7b-bf93-9d45b7190d75-2
00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:45.073
attacked considering the fact
that in 2021 or 22 if I'm

36766c11-d7e4-4c7b-bf93-9d45b7190d75-3
00:47:45.073 --> 00:47:45.490
correct?

cb503e28-93d7-415f-91da-f9eedd818800-0
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.653
It was the Indian healthcare
system especially. It was one of

cb503e28-93d7-415f-91da-f9eedd818800-1
00:47:49.653 --> 00:47:53.012
the most attacked in the world
only after the US, especially

cb503e28-93d7-415f-91da-f9eedd818800-2
00:47:53.012 --> 00:47:56.260
when it came to cyber attacks.
So does it mean only it was

cb503e28-93d7-415f-91da-f9eedd818800-3
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.839
because of the lack of any laws,
regulations for the sector? No,

cb503e28-93d7-415f-91da-f9eedd818800-4
00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:00.500
not exactly.

e38dc69f-cce8-489e-b174-a7cd3b0e07b3-0
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.168
The reason being is that Indian
healthcare systems have been

e38dc69f-cce8-489e-b174-a7cd3b0e07b3-1
00:48:05.168 --> 00:48:08.972
targeted because of we have
dedicatedly created a very good

e38dc69f-cce8-489e-b174-a7cd3b0e07b3-2
00:48:08.972 --> 00:48:09.480
vaccine.

439e6b4e-94d2-44ab-b422-7ed14623568f-0
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.147
Because of that, they want to
understand not only the

439e6b4e-94d2-44ab-b422-7ed14623568f-1
00:48:14.147 --> 00:48:17.493
medicals, also our where
actually the vaccines has been

439e6b4e-94d2-44ab-b422-7ed14623568f-2
00:48:17.493 --> 00:48:21.199
manufactured, how it has been
manufactured, there have been a

439e6b4e-94d2-44ab-b422-7ed14623568f-3
00:48:21.199 --> 00:48:24.784
lot of state actors are also
behind it to know you mean the

439e6b4e-94d2-44ab-b422-7ed14623568f-4
00:48:24.784 --> 00:48:25.980
COVID vaccines, yes.

225dc47a-3900-4106-9bd2-266f14165d48-0
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:30.752
So that that is 1 motivation for
knowing what are the how.

225dc47a-3900-4106-9bd2-266f14165d48-1
00:48:30.752 --> 00:48:34.725
Actually India is much ahead
than others to know a lot of

225dc47a-3900-4106-9bd2-266f14165d48-2
00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:38.768
things. So that is the one
aspect. The other aspect I told

225dc47a-3900-4106-9bd2-266f14165d48-3
00:48:38.768 --> 00:48:42.741
you 14163 attacks per week is
happening to Indian medical

225dc47a-3900-4106-9bd2-266f14165d48-4
00:48:42.741 --> 00:48:43.290
systems.

50b4ec43-cf1e-4da3-93cd-b00118bcf185-0
00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:48.736
College 14163 in per week is
happening to the Indian medical

50b4ec43-cf1e-4da3-93cd-b00118bcf185-1
00:48:48.736 --> 00:48:52.770
system. It is not by me, it is
given in the research.

3231802d-5e00-4bd2-bf09-8173cb794dd4-0
00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:58.057
The research finding explain, so
if that is coming so basically

3231802d-5e00-4bd2-bf09-8173cb794dd4-1
00:48:58.057 --> 00:48:58.870
what happens?

16ae05ce-e8f7-44ef-8b63-327f6f91be5c-0
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:03.776
Once this, that means, uh, they
are also being blocked. It is

16ae05ce-e8f7-44ef-8b63-327f6f91be5c-1
00:49:03.776 --> 00:49:07.903
not that Indian medical system
do not have a firewall, do not

16ae05ce-e8f7-44ef-8b63-327f6f91be5c-2
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:12.096
have ideas or they do not have a
CM tool. All these things are

16ae05ce-e8f7-44ef-8b63-327f6f91be5c-3
00:49:12.096 --> 00:49:15.956
there. But what amazed rightly
told, it's a sophisticated

16ae05ce-e8f7-44ef-8b63-327f6f91be5c-4
00:49:15.956 --> 00:49:18.220
ransomware which has been
coming.

9df239d4-736c-475e-8e6a-6ad8efe968e9-0
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:24.603
I have not gone through uh AMS
case, but I have gone through

9df239d4-736c-475e-8e6a-6ad8efe968e9-1
00:49:24.603 --> 00:49:29.234
the NHS case. What has happened
when they they click that link?

9df239d4-736c-475e-8e6a-6ad8efe968e9-2
00:49:29.234 --> 00:49:33.575
That receptionist the link has
downloaded the moment it has

9df239d4-736c-475e-8e6a-6ad8efe968e9-3
00:49:33.575 --> 00:49:38.061
been downloaded that EXE file.
That EXE file does not created

9df239d4-736c-475e-8e6a-6ad8efe968e9-4
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:38.640
any hub.

182129f6-e9b1-4dfa-a6a2-3ac2a79300e7-0
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.840
It throws another ex file to 10
persons.

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-0
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.041
And that created sending and
disrupting the computers. So

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-1
00:49:48.041 --> 00:49:52.307
this is how actually they have
embedded or run somewheres are

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-2
00:49:52.307 --> 00:49:56.642
coming in the near future. So
which has been developing by the

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-3
00:49:56.642 --> 00:50:00.840
dark web and you can go through
it, you will find out lot of

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-4
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:04.969
ransomwares which have been
dedicatedly for working for the

7e949bda-f00a-4abb-b697-8e2dbe430ca5-5
00:50:04.969 --> 00:50:06.070
medical systems.

c7710ba7-a787-45e2-8304-906ebd34f331-0
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:12.380
So recently also in Black Hat
Conference, we'll find out there

c7710ba7-a787-45e2-8304-906ebd34f331-1
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.274
are a lot of discussions
happening in the medical systems

c7710ba7-a787-45e2-8304-906ebd34f331-2
00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:20.101
because they feel because of
this pandemic this has been

c7710ba7-a787-45e2-8304-906ebd34f331-3
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:20.840
sharp rise.

a5922d50-14c6-4e3b-892a-a79d76562ee1-0
00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:29.563
So what we saw had happened in
the UK post NHS there were

a5922d50-14c6-4e3b-892a-a79d76562ee1-1
00:50:29.563 --> 00:50:34.367
advisories which were there. So
for example if any healthcare

a5922d50-14c6-4e3b-892a-a79d76562ee1-2
00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:39.093
systems gets hacked then what
needs to be done? What are the

a5922d50-14c6-4e3b-892a-a79d76562ee1-3
00:50:39.093 --> 00:50:41.339
resources that are available?

c60c6250-603f-473a-a67e-4d3f1c69880a-0
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.197
Right. What are some of the best
practices that need to be

c60c6250-603f-473a-a67e-4d3f1c69880a-1
00:50:46.197 --> 00:50:50.317
followed? Uh, post the incident.
Uh, if you look at today, what

c60c6250-603f-473a-a67e-4d3f1c69880a-2
00:50:50.317 --> 00:50:51.090
happened in?

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-0
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.463
Aims, uh, you know, what are
some of the key learnings that

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-1
00:50:55.463 --> 00:50:59.289
India could look ahead? We only
can go to the websites of NCI,

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-2
00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:02.993
PCC or CERT. So if we, India
will have to develop advisories

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-3
00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:06.697
or we'll have to build up a
mechanism for incident response.

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-4
00:51:06.697 --> 00:51:10.098
What are some of the aspects
that need to be developed,

c33c947b-24da-4f39-8543-618c06fccd26-5
00:51:10.098 --> 00:51:11.070
tenants want to?

c0fdd75f-3b5d-429f-bf52-1a216c107f1f-0
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:16.350
Yeah, thanks, kanish. Can you
hear me?

210c12da-0dba-4297-9223-a04be7e59ec7-0
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:17.350
Yeah.

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-0
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:22.000
Yeah. No, I think this is very
interesting uh, discussion over

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-1
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.725
the last 15 odd minutes slide.
And the first thing uh, when

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-2
00:51:25.725 --> 00:51:29.573
there was a question said why
are we getting targeted so much

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-3
00:51:29.573 --> 00:51:33.608
and and what are we missing and
they will again promptly said we

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-4
00:51:33.608 --> 00:51:37.084
do not have AC so in the
healthcare industries yet. And

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-5
00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:40.374
the practitioners who are
actually looking after the

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-6
00:51:40.374 --> 00:51:43.974
infrastructure are are more IT
or software or application

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-7
00:51:43.974 --> 00:51:47.388
oriented. I think there is a
need one for a very clear

25862bd5-d23a-4b8a-9496-86f0f364f1ad-8
00:51:47.388 --> 00:51:48.320
directive also.

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-0
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.238
Because sometimes it's, you
know, there is something like is

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-1
00:51:52.238 --> 00:51:56.065
nice to have and something that
is must have. I think it's time

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-2
00:51:56.065 --> 00:51:59.773
that cyber security regulation
or or norm becomes more like a

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-3
00:51:59.773 --> 00:52:03.421
must have for you know, for
healthcare in India. That is one

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-4
00:52:03.421 --> 00:52:07.129
that's my point of view, right.
And whether that's, you know,

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-5
00:52:07.129 --> 00:52:10.718
having a CSO and then there's
various other form factors or

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-6
00:52:10.718 --> 00:52:14.246
procedures like for example if
we just look at our banking

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-7
00:52:14.246 --> 00:52:18.014
sector, I mean that's a great
example of the work that RBI has

3f3ace2c-fb1a-4c52-8233-b8e7f5360216-8
00:52:18.014 --> 00:52:19.390
done and the amount of.

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-0
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.727
Education and knowledge sharing
and and and guided guidelines

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-1
00:52:23.727 --> 00:52:27.808
that have been put in place that
has really strengthened the

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-2
00:52:27.808 --> 00:52:31.889
structure and of course we can
do more there but I think you

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-3
00:52:31.889 --> 00:52:35.702
know that's a that's a good
mature sector to look at and

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-4
00:52:35.702 --> 00:52:39.850
learn from and today Healthcare
is becoming you know critical

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-5
00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:43.997
sector for us and and that is
where the future is in terms of

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-6
00:52:43.997 --> 00:52:48.078
digitization and accessibility
for, for, for even for beyond

7ea3f13c-2d0c-4a21-b83c-f083f62decd8-7
00:52:48.078 --> 00:52:50.420
the metros and as you go into
the.

3b94b285-6c1b-4346-b18b-08e7efb82542-0
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.381
You know, the smaller cities and
villages and all, so it's very

3b94b285-6c1b-4346-b18b-08e7efb82542-1
00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:58.324
critical that we have the right
framework in place. You know, we

3b94b285-6c1b-4346-b18b-08e7efb82542-2
00:52:58.324 --> 00:53:02.145
put that and then that really
builds the highways for creating

3b94b285-6c1b-4346-b18b-08e7efb82542-3
00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:05.300
a digital healthcare
infrastructure for the future.

e4abb570-c149-41f3-a79d-328064ea5fa8-0
00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:12.924
You know, while you were
involved in investigating the

e4abb570-c149-41f3-a79d-328064ea5fa8-1
00:53:12.924 --> 00:53:16.609
aims attack, right? And there
were multiple agencies, what

e4abb570-c149-41f3-a79d-328064ea5fa8-2
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:20.043
were some of the keys
challenges? You think there were

e4abb570-c149-41f3-a79d-328064ea5fa8-3
00:53:20.043 --> 00:53:21.480
more cooks in the room?

b246812d-5250-4035-8f03-8a49a0e50106-0
00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:26.282
Were there access to resources?
Was there information sharing?

b246812d-5250-4035-8f03-8a49a0e50106-1
00:53:26.282 --> 00:53:29.190
What, what, what, what are some
of the key learnings?

9fa83672-2f39-4bda-9a24-e8d23096ac94-0
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:31.280
Unfortunately.

a9f8ad25-6de3-4c39-a143-092c512c56b2-0
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:33.780
Yeah, sure. Please, please.

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-0
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.305
Sorry, was that question for me
or was that for that for

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-1
00:53:37.305 --> 00:53:40.140
somebody in the room? I
couldn't. No, that was for Amit

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-2
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.380
since he was involved in. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-3
00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:46.620
I was just, I thought it's funny
and I was like, I was not part

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-4
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.353
of the investigation. So I'm
sorry. I was part of the

7bd46929-c20e-4722-a2ea-a1d8da35ef84-5
00:53:49.353 --> 00:53:50.670
investigation. That's why.

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-0
00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.371
People, I'll give you a few
informations that every such

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-1
00:53:55.371 --> 00:53:58.612
agency, those were involved,
they had a different mandate,

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-2
00:53:58.612 --> 00:54:01.799
they were not doing the same
thing. For example, if Delhi

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-3
00:54:01.799 --> 00:54:05.095
Police was involved or CPI was
involved and even later they

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-4
00:54:05.095 --> 00:54:08.611
they look from an IT perspective
as well. I 4C was involved. So

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-5
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.687
every agency has a different
mandate. Some of them were

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-6
00:54:11.687 --> 00:54:14.929
trying to find the root cause,
some of them were trying to

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-7
00:54:14.929 --> 00:54:18.390
attribute it to somewhere, some
of them were trying to recover

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-8
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.741
the data or some of them were
trying to see that if there is

3ca14ace-c755-48be-a51d-a9a68f483564-9
00:54:21.741 --> 00:54:23.060
any insider possibility.

edf7c4d6-ea4d-46de-b164-692af15b2025-0
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.232
So I think we need to understand
that each of this mandate is

edf7c4d6-ea4d-46de-b164-692af15b2025-1
00:54:26.232 --> 00:54:28.760
different and they require
different sort of work.

68afa1d9-8660-4bba-bdfe-0371ea897f82-0
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:33.769
If you say that, why could not
they record because none of them

68afa1d9-8660-4bba-bdfe-0371ea897f82-1
00:54:33.769 --> 00:54:36.741
were actually trying to recover
the data. They they had a

68afa1d9-8660-4bba-bdfe-0371ea897f82-2
00:54:36.741 --> 00:54:39.919
different mandate and they were
working in that direction. So

68afa1d9-8660-4bba-bdfe-0371ea897f82-3
00:54:39.919 --> 00:54:43.250
that's why it took time and that
their existing IT system or the

68afa1d9-8660-4bba-bdfe-0371ea897f82-4
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:44.069
manager when we.

943d10e1-4e64-4461-b8ba-26f66ab5a385-0
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:48.508
When they were discussing, and
somehow I was asking, the basic

943d10e1-4e64-4461-b8ba-26f66ab5a385-1
00:54:48.508 --> 00:54:51.470
processes involved in their
day-to-day operations.

0d6b31f8-f84b-4979-a887-657a385746b7-0
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.789
And when I realized like they
didn't have a backup process or

0d6b31f8-f84b-4979-a887-657a385746b7-1
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:59.195
they were missing some of these
regular check process, I became

0d6b31f8-f84b-4979-a887-657a385746b7-2
00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:02.335
little furious. And then I
realized like the person who is

0d6b31f8-f84b-4979-a887-657a385746b7-3
00:55:02.335 --> 00:55:05.050
in front of me, he he mentioned
that I'm a doctor.

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-0
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.808
So I was shocked that you had a
doctor and I was thinking you

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-1
00:55:08.808 --> 00:55:11.925
are an IT guy. So that's why I
was expecting these things from

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-2
00:55:11.925 --> 00:55:14.697
you. He said no, no, I'm a
doctor, but I'm, I'm holding

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-3
00:55:14.697 --> 00:55:17.864
this responsibility. So this was
first such shocking moment for

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-4
00:55:17.864 --> 00:55:21.031
me and I think this is happening
with every such other hospital

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-5
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:24.099
that they they give this as an
additional responsibility to a

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-6
00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:26.821
doctor. They they, they don't
have a dedicated person,

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-7
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:29.790
technical person who could
actually answer these questions.

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-8
00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:32.760
And we are taking it to like I
think I agree with all other

291c01b5-42ef-4bff-bc13-36354d7dafc1-9
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:33.750
such panelists that.

7637b3f4-093d-464c-8005-88569f571d45-0
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.050
That they this is their uh site.

b5574e6b-b244-4937-9376-56ceac4a5a7f-0
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:42.446
Responsibility, not a main
responsibility. And this was my,

b5574e6b-b244-4937-9376-56ceac4a5a7f-1
00:55:42.446 --> 00:55:45.470
my, my, my, such first-hand
experience.

ec909f8e-3be7-4758-a867-a635d914b618-0
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:48.953
And then I said, OK, if you are
a doctor, then um, who is doing

ec909f8e-3be7-4758-a867-a635d914b618-1
00:55:48.953 --> 00:55:51.405
what? Can you tell me the
people, those are responsible

ec909f8e-3be7-4758-a867-a635d914b618-2
00:55:51.405 --> 00:55:51.800
for that?

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-0
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.059
And then I realized that he is
the only person who's doing many

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-1
00:55:56.059 --> 00:55:59.498
things. So. So I think these are
some of the revelations. And

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-2
00:55:59.498 --> 00:56:02.881
then we had to start afresh, OK,
let we'll go to the system,

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-3
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:06.043
we'll see that what all
possibilities are there. We need

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-4
00:56:06.043 --> 00:56:09.315
to create clones of the data and
then distribute it across

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-5
00:56:09.315 --> 00:56:12.643
multiple agencies so that they
can start working from their

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-6
00:56:12.643 --> 00:56:16.082
angles, capturing the log. So
basic things were also missing.

7e981fc3-d81a-4f31-8805-d5d96f946b8f-7
00:56:16.082 --> 00:56:18.190
They didn't have even. What do I
say?

3334449f-2ed7-4920-8b61-bf80a930d9c1-0
00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.944
That if I will ask that OK, if
there is a Wi-Fi system in

3334449f-2ed7-4920-8b61-bf80a930d9c1-1
00:56:22.944 --> 00:56:26.619
place, who is managing that
Wi-Fi and what were the password

3334449f-2ed7-4920-8b61-bf80a930d9c1-2
00:56:26.619 --> 00:56:29.090
policies even this thing was not
proper?

620b5654-6a6f-4b78-849a-0c20b2210edb-0
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.116
So they said, oh, there's a
person who knows about it, we'll

620b5654-6a6f-4b78-849a-0c20b2210edb-1
00:56:33.116 --> 00:56:36.407
get, we'll get it, we'll get it.
So I said, oh, if he's the

620b5654-6a6f-4b78-849a-0c20b2210edb-2
00:56:36.407 --> 00:56:39.808
person, if he's not available,
and if he's on leave, then who

620b5654-6a6f-4b78-849a-0c20b2210edb-3
00:56:39.808 --> 00:56:42.771
is responsible doesn't have
answer. So I think we can

620b5654-6a6f-4b78-849a-0c20b2210edb-4
00:56:42.771 --> 00:56:43.210
realize.

107c6e7a-c6d4-416d-95cd-8e368b8cc84e-0
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:49.161
Poor situation of our IT
networks and hospitals and this

107c6e7a-c6d4-416d-95cd-8e368b8cc84e-1
00:56:49.161 --> 00:56:50.280
is a learning.

109bf8c6-83e1-468c-837e-486d55736517-0
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.230
And then I asked like why? Why
is? Why is it so?

d11551b7-c1e2-4cf6-b461-30d103aff524-0
00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.492
So they told me that we never
thought that anybody would

d11551b7-c1e2-4cf6-b461-30d103aff524-1
00:56:57.492 --> 00:56:58.230
attack hospitals.

463060cd-7f34-4d22-a753-4783227e77b3-0
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.222
This was their mindset problem
as well. They said no, no, I

463060cd-7f34-4d22-a753-4783227e77b3-1
00:57:02.222 --> 00:57:05.194
think why would anybody will
attack hospital, what they'll

463060cd-7f34-4d22-a753-4783227e77b3-2
00:57:05.194 --> 00:57:05.900
get out of it.

0a6532f7-8c9a-47bf-8419-1e34e0ee3b97-0
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.464
This is just some healthcare
data, so I think the next

0a6532f7-8c9a-47bf-8419-1e34e0ee3b97-1
00:57:09.464 --> 00:57:12.360
problem is that they don't
understand the value of data.

44489007-9d90-4967-a92d-f245fcaa01c5-0
00:57:13.290 --> 00:57:16.427
And unless until you don't
understand the value of your

44489007-9d90-4967-a92d-f245fcaa01c5-1
00:57:16.427 --> 00:57:19.060
asset, you will not put that
focus to protect.

b6c2fbf2-724b-46f9-9a96-3a54bea5cd06-0
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:24.354
So this is something which we
cannot just implant all of a

b6c2fbf2-724b-46f9-9a96-3a54bea5cd06-1
00:57:24.354 --> 00:57:28.832
sudden through policies. It
should come through some top

b6c2fbf2-724b-46f9-9a96-3a54bea5cd06-2
00:57:28.832 --> 00:57:33.702
level mandate to be passed to
them that, oh, this is required

b6c2fbf2-724b-46f9-9a96-3a54bea5cd06-3
00:57:33.702 --> 00:57:38.730
because of the national interest
and there are people that are.

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-0
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:44.703
Those are going to monitor it on
a regular basis. So I think

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-1
00:57:44.703 --> 00:57:47.978
these are the things which is
missing right now and every

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-2
00:57:47.978 --> 00:57:51.252
hospital and these are the
government hospital and when I

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-3
00:57:51.252 --> 00:57:54.301
see the private hospital as
well, they are also going

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-4
00:57:54.301 --> 00:57:57.688
through the similar kind of
patch holes and loopholes. So I

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-5
00:57:57.688 --> 00:58:00.962
have visited few private
hospitals also because on breach

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-6
00:58:00.962 --> 00:58:04.293
point we got some information,
there is a website I'm just

e2ce400c-b6f9-4a44-8200-f6d31ecd8bbd-7
00:58:04.293 --> 00:58:07.059
missing which which publishes
the data breaches.

ed0595e1-e9c0-4317-96eb-dec97fe67bde-0
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:11.399
And uh, we were just looking
into those informations. We

ed0595e1-e9c0-4317-96eb-dec97fe67bde-1
00:58:11.399 --> 00:58:15.315
found that in India before Ames
there were close to thousand

ed0595e1-e9c0-4317-96eb-dec97fe67bde-2
00:58:15.315 --> 00:58:19.423
such attacks. I think Sarah has
mentioned rightly thousand 1463

ed0595e1-e9c0-4317-96eb-dec97fe67bde-3
00:58:19.423 --> 00:58:23.532
something this number of attacks
within two weeks or one week I

ed0595e1-e9c0-4317-96eb-dec97fe67bde-4
00:58:23.532 --> 00:58:24.110
I'm sure.

1e190959-a77e-476b-a959-28c1e8189d80-0
00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:28.843
And there were uh successful uh
such attempts on few South

1e190959-a77e-476b-a959-28c1e8189d80-1
00:58:28.843 --> 00:58:31.570
Indian hospitals and the data
was there.

032587a1-4a65-4599-b4f6-4d4158011f5a-0
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:36.617
So I was asked to just look into
those root causes as well, that

032587a1-4a65-4599-b4f6-4d4158011f5a-1
00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:40.150
is it the similar kind of
ransomware or is it different?

4542df46-2327-4b17-b24c-072233df6aba-0
00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:44.841
The attack vector or the source
of attack? Whether it could be

4542df46-2327-4b17-b24c-072233df6aba-1
00:58:44.841 --> 00:58:46.700
attributed to the same people.

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-0
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:50.683
And we were doing that
additional work as well along

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-1
00:58:50.683 --> 00:58:54.071
with investigating the aims. So
I think there were multiple

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-2
00:58:54.071 --> 00:58:57.516
learnings. First of all, I'm not
supposed to reveal a few of

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-3
00:58:57.516 --> 00:59:00.847
these things over here, but
these learnings can be used to

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-4
00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:04.518
make our future better. And I'm
sure these are, this is just the

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-5
00:59:04.518 --> 00:59:07.793
beginning, this is just the
beginning. The biggest bigger

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-6
00:59:07.793 --> 00:59:11.351
damage could happen and we'll
probably we should not see it in

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-7
00:59:11.351 --> 00:59:14.570
future, but it could be life
threatening as well that if

89a6a3dd-a3e0-40a1-b226-a2bd43355acf-8
00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.620
suppose some some operation is
going on at that time.

a91f4b0a-5f99-4cd3-86ca-259606736a42-0
00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:21.398
The system is collapsed and they
could not get the vital

a91f4b0a-5f99-4cd3-86ca-259606736a42-1
00:59:21.398 --> 00:59:25.380
parameters of a person. Uh, they
cannot operate a person and that

a91f4b0a-5f99-4cd3-86ca-259606736a42-2
00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.939
is something which can also
happen. Uh, I think we should.

8d8ea430-01a8-4857-8122-a8486c5c2490-0
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.739
Segregate. First of all, we
should have a segregation

8d8ea430-01a8-4857-8122-a8486c5c2490-1
00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:33.310
mechanism.

5ffb1767-ccfc-49ca-8769-2b068550bbbf-0
00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:37.163
An attack which was which
happened on e-mail server should

5ffb1767-ccfc-49ca-8769-2b068550bbbf-1
00:59:37.163 --> 00:59:40.329
not percolate to the other
databases which happened in this

5ffb1767-ccfc-49ca-8769-2b068550bbbf-2
00:59:40.329 --> 00:59:43.020
case. So e-mail communication is
a separate thing.

ed7a85ba-35be-4bf6-9821-329e01ec0080-0
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:46.680
The Opd's management is separate
thing the.

2c51117b-902d-4706-b82b-ae5323e4b737-0
00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:50.648
Diagnostic servers as separate
things, so I think the

2c51117b-902d-4706-b82b-ae5323e4b737-1
00:59:50.648 --> 00:59:52.580
segregation should be proper
and.

6424d304-4325-4c5f-bd51-b9e81bcea35d-0
00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:57.367
That is the first thing that we
should recommend in every search

6424d304-4325-4c5f-bd51-b9e81bcea35d-1
00:59:57.367 --> 00:59:58.290
hospital second.

9f219eaa-315b-495d-9761-5daa54b10a30-0
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.960
We should also consider uh
recent news from China. Uh, they

9f219eaa-315b-495d-9761-5daa54b10a30-1
01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.860
they cracked RSA 204 bit through
114 qubit quantum computers.

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-0
01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.637
And RSA 204 bit is the basic
encryption backbone against most

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-1
01:00:13.637 --> 01:00:17.806
of these uh database securities
or credit, debit card securities

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-2
01:00:17.806 --> 01:00:21.462
or even VPN securities. So if
RSA 204 bit can be cracked

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-3
01:00:21.462 --> 01:00:24.926
through 114 qubit quantum
computer which is available

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-4
01:00:24.926 --> 01:00:28.967
today, it is not something which
we are expecting in future. I

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-5
01:00:28.967 --> 01:00:33.008
think this is a big, this is,
this is really a serious concern

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-6
01:00:33.008 --> 01:00:36.601
and this will, this will
threaten banking industries as

8f1cf55c-5ceb-4dd7-94d3-7c3bc8bff6d7-7
01:00:36.601 --> 01:00:39.680
well and so all other critical
infrastructures.

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-0
01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:44.235
So I think we need to come up
with more sophisticated quantum

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-1
01:00:44.235 --> 01:00:48.267
safe algorithms, whether it is
crystal kyber, crystal dilithium

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-2
01:00:48.267 --> 01:00:52.047
or any other recommendation, and
start working towards that

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-3
01:00:52.047 --> 01:00:55.638
before it becomes too late,
because this transition will

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-4
01:00:55.638 --> 01:00:59.481
itself take a year almost. We
have huge data, huge networks,

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-5
01:00:59.481 --> 01:01:03.387
distributed and complex. So we
need to think from now onwards

7265d132-03f2-4b26-becd-f395434507e9-6
01:01:03.387 --> 01:01:05.339
we need to become quantum safe.

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-0
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.411
We should change all these
encryption mechanisms to

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-1
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:13.255
available quantum safe options.
Thank you. Very interesting

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-2
01:01:13.255 --> 01:01:17.227
point. And I want to bring in
Doctor Debu because he's done a

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-3
01:01:17.227 --> 01:01:20.943
lot of work, you know, on
quantum, on encryption and he's

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-4
01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:24.915
got a lot of expertise on China
particularly. So Doctor Dibu,

dcba3e2f-04ca-4d6a-bb66-16d263968046-5
01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:27.350
over to you on some of these
aspects.

d6a588d1-f1a1-4175-92e3-6f12aef17735-0
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:33.291
OK. He doesn't want to talk
about China. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

d6a588d1-f1a1-4175-92e3-6f12aef17735-1
01:01:33.291 --> 01:01:38.193
Because the other main views are
very personal, not related to my

d6a588d1-f1a1-4175-92e3-6f12aef17735-2
01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:42.649
company. So. So, yeah, what
Kanishk told is very important.

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-0
01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.885
Whenever you have any
cryptographic methods, is there

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-1
01:01:47.885 --> 01:01:52.113
any kind of system whether it is
a the algorithms are used?

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-2
01:01:52.113 --> 01:01:55.706
Basically they're
cryptographically algorithms. As

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-3
01:01:55.706 --> 01:02:00.075
Amija rightly point out, RSA
works on factorial algorithm and

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-4
01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:04.373
elliptic curve works on group
mode arithmetic. So you need a

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-5
01:02:04.373 --> 01:02:08.320
very stringent mathematics
understanding when you build

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-6
01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.477
these kind of algorithms. What
are you finding? We need to

c98e8f2c-703a-4ad7-b7ce-d5feef9fc6e8-7
01:02:12.477 --> 01:02:14.380
build the reverse analysis.

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-0
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:18.376
Abdul journalist algorithms
building or writing an

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-1
01:02:18.376 --> 01:02:23.061
encryption algorithm is very
easy. Suppose I want to encrypt

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-2
01:02:23.061 --> 01:02:27.669
some kind of data by using RSA
2048. It is very easy. I can

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-3
01:02:27.669 --> 01:02:32.508
write an encryption algorithm by
using RSA algorithm, by using

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-4
01:02:32.508 --> 01:02:37.116
elliptic curve algorithm or by
using quantum. But doing the

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-5
01:02:37.116 --> 01:02:42.031
reverse engineering it will be
very very difficult what we call

e2c392c8-5050-409e-89d7-12fc2944b823-6
01:02:42.031 --> 01:02:44.720
in terms of cryptography
language.

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-0
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.053
We call it as a crypt analysis.
So we need to develop that

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-1
01:02:49.053 --> 01:02:53.306
factors in our country to
understand what are the various.

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-2
01:02:53.306 --> 01:02:58.063
If that capability we could have
been there then the attack which

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-3
01:02:58.063 --> 01:03:02.821
has been happened which has been
encrypted the disk we could have

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-4
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:07.363
any immediately decrypted back.
We did not have the capability

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-5
01:03:07.363 --> 01:03:11.832
to decrypt back what are the
datas are present. So that's why

3d966ab8-a6df-4312-b5f8-80447dfdcb28-6
01:03:11.832 --> 01:03:14.859
my humble request is in the
universities.

d6429a39-52e9-47a0-b9c8-927d344b2344-0
01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:21.060
In the undergrad students in the
PhD, we must create some kind

d6429a39-52e9-47a0-b9c8-927d344b2344-1
01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:21.350
of.

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-0
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.130
People, those are crypto
analytics and they can have the

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-1
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.030
real power who can do this
analysis and they can decode

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-2
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.558
this kind of algorithms and they
can really decode back what are

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-3
01:03:34.558 --> 01:03:38.528
the original messages either
suppose the messages or the

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-4
01:03:38.528 --> 01:03:42.707
files have been stored in the
database. Database encryption

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-5
01:03:42.707 --> 01:03:46.956
and database decryption is a
completely different processes.

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-6
01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:51.414
If we even decrypt the database
it does not give you the enough

d9b977f3-b531-48e4-b31d-e308173bacd1-7
01:03:51.414 --> 01:03:52.250
information.

c67364b7-23c2-4228-b947-082fb54a09cc-0
01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:55.256
People do not decrypt back. What
are the files stored in the

c67364b7-23c2-4228-b947-082fb54a09cc-1
01:03:55.256 --> 01:03:55.690
database?

d614e2bf-feec-44bf-b9fc-0ab7ff6ced71-0
01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.121
Even if you go to the file
level, if you do not have the

d614e2bf-feec-44bf-b9fc-0ab7ff6ced71-1
01:04:00.121 --> 01:04:03.555
permission level in the files
then also you do not have the

d614e2bf-feec-44bf-b9fc-0ab7ff6ced71-2
01:04:03.555 --> 01:04:04.699
capability to do it.

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-0
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:09.963
So in fact when I was doing my
PhD at IIT Bombay, I used to

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-1
01:04:09.963 --> 01:04:14.776
crack a lot of algorithms. So I
know how hard it is. You have to

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-2
01:04:14.776 --> 01:04:19.442
spend a lot of nights and then
you will understand the how the

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-3
01:04:19.442 --> 01:04:23.885
algorithms work in step by step.
Then you have to go in the

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-4
01:04:23.885 --> 01:04:27.958
reverse way and you have to
crack those algorithms. So

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-5
01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:32.549
that's why I agree with karnish.
Educational and awareness is

b3a0f8d6-c688-4e65-8f20-9cda5ca7c0df-6
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:36.030
very important to build across
our institutes.

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-0
01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:40.585
And across our systems, so that
we'll develop some kind of

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-1
01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:44.964
crypto analytics and those
analytics not only help to our

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-2
01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:49.797
cyber force, they will also help
to the nation building because

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-3
01:04:49.797 --> 01:04:54.781
in the time of emergency as Amit
Ji rightly told the operation is

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-4
01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:59.311
going on. If the particular
let's say heartbeat, the hacker

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-5
01:04:59.311 --> 01:05:03.465
sitting at a distance remote
place, he will change the

78ca1e8f-122a-49dc-82da-3c4a70fbf5b8-6
01:05:03.465 --> 01:05:06.410
heartbeat or he will change the
BP so.

4e692e1a-8d2f-409e-9f3c-1d037ba3f370-0
01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:09.623
You will find out there will be
a lot of parameter variation

4e692e1a-8d2f-409e-9f3c-1d037ba3f370-1
01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:12.860
will happen the moment actually
the robotic surgery will come.

ad9ac1bf-1dcc-497e-b027-5a533bfb379e-0
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:17.354
And knowing the robotic surgery
will come, who will do the

ad9ac1bf-1dcc-497e-b027-5a533bfb379e-1
01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:20.808
operations. It is AI based
algorithms and these AI based

ad9ac1bf-1dcc-497e-b027-5a533bfb379e-2
01:05:20.808 --> 01:05:24.564
algorithms, as you are rightly
told, there are many countries

ad9ac1bf-1dcc-497e-b027-5a533bfb379e-3
01:05:24.564 --> 01:05:26.140
which are not transparent.

73a09523-46d8-4010-8612-70138027f748-0
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.648
How Can you believe that they
are developing the algorithms

73a09523-46d8-4010-8612-70138027f748-1
01:05:29.648 --> 01:05:31.500
which will be transparent and
ethical?

b757e25f-4147-4089-bf96-08932915894d-0
01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.141
So that will also create a lot
of problem in the medical

b757e25f-4147-4089-bf96-08932915894d-1
01:05:36.141 --> 01:05:40.053
industry if they are not
purchasing the right equipment

b757e25f-4147-4089-bf96-08932915894d-2
01:05:40.053 --> 01:05:41.800
from the trusted sources.

c4cdde98-aed0-4a74-b4a8-89e3d0b34c16-0
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:46.328
So that way actually it will be
very imperative to understand

c4cdde98-aed0-4a74-b4a8-89e3d0b34c16-1
01:05:46.328 --> 01:05:50.145
how actually the cryptographic
system works and how actually we

c4cdde98-aed0-4a74-b4a8-89e3d0b34c16-2
01:05:50.145 --> 01:05:53.903
will find out to use those kind
of systems in your system like

c4cdde98-aed0-4a74-b4a8-89e3d0b34c16-3
01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:57.482
medical environment and then you
will decrypt back the your

c4cdde98-aed0-4a74-b4a8-89e3d0b34c16-4
01:05:57.482 --> 01:05:59.510
information when it is
necessary.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:05.371
Thank you, doctor Debu. So we've
also been joined by Kapil Madan,

2f8209d7-5b48-4df2-bc3a-328b44d25367-1

law for.

707cc4f3-fe1a-484d-9e26-0fb0f4a5c986-0
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.171
Government of India, Ministry of
Electronics, Information

01:06:17.171 --> 01:06:20.390
Technology and UH I welcome
Major General Pavan Anand, who's

707cc4f3-fe1a-484d-9e26-0fb0f4a5c986-2
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:23.716
a distinguished fellow at United
Services Institution of India

707cc4f3-fe1a-484d-9e26-0fb0f4a5c986-3
01:06:23.716 --> 01:06:24.930
and director at Mudcat.

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-0
01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:30.779
Anand, I would want to bring you
in here. So far we haven't seen

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-1
01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:34.974
that healthcare was considered
important from a geopolitical

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-2
01:06:34.974 --> 01:06:39.100
standpoint or in doctrines of
warfare. Healthcare was never

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-3
01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:43.157
considered as a sector which
could be attacked, right? But

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-4
01:06:43.157 --> 01:06:47.421
over a period of time, things
have changed. Healthcare is now

6b6f27f8-071b-41d6-aa72-f5d02cd9fbf6-5
01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:48.040
becoming.

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-0
01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.784
Important so when it look at
National Safety, security or

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-1
01:06:52.784 --> 01:06:56.563
geopolitics, what has really
changed? Is it because of

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-2
01:06:56.563 --> 01:07:00.410
COVID-19 pandemic or is it
because of the after effects

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-3
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:04.532
that people have realized that
this sector also needs to be

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-4
01:07:04.532 --> 01:07:08.929
taken into consideration? Or is
it just that we see the hackers

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-5
01:07:08.929 --> 01:07:13.189
see more value in the data which
they get from the healthcare

4ec55473-6a8d-4f3b-8d82-bb43eed4f683-6
01:07:13.189 --> 01:07:13.670
sector?

ee705c60-993c-4d50-a8e2-290fc9350a0a-0
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:17.580
Thanks, ganishka. Can you hear
me?

2a7da323-d004-41f8-b7ac-04b123121600-0
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:22.693
Uh, sorry, I came in a little
late and uh got caught up with

2a7da323-d004-41f8-b7ac-04b123121600-1
01:07:22.693 --> 01:07:24.180
something else, but uh.

b282e5ff-5dfb-4e81-9fae-dd1ea5cd8e06-0
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.020
My apologies to everyone here.

5be0223e-6970-42cd-9a81-2111c4e88f90-0
01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:32.251
So although I've come in late
and I seem to have missed out on

5be0223e-6970-42cd-9a81-2111c4e88f90-1
01:07:32.251 --> 01:07:35.777
some of the uh, you know the
introductory remarks which have

5be0223e-6970-42cd-9a81-2111c4e88f90-2
01:07:35.777 --> 01:07:39.360
been very interesting and also
from folks out, I think what I

5be0223e-6970-42cd-9a81-2111c4e88f90-3
01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.655
can just throw some throw up
more issues than I can give

5be0223e-6970-42cd-9a81-2111c4e88f90-4
01:07:42.655 --> 01:07:44.100
answers actually because.

3df451c3-c720-471b-bb9b-dadd043e3ad5-0
01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.990
The way the Ukraine war and the
COVID pandemic have.

37728d0a-d44c-4fd2-b606-6b16f4ff2909-0
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:53.560
Actually put us more into the
digital domain than ever before.

f2f269b9-f5f5-47e1-a130-72c6158550fd-0
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.129
We seem to be more enabled, but
at the same time we are more

f2f269b9-f5f5-47e1-a130-72c6158550fd-1
01:07:59.129 --> 01:07:59.820
vulnerable.

40c5f32d-3f60-411b-b511-4e80a8efcb53-0
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.863
So every sector which which is
now using the digital medium and

40c5f32d-3f60-411b-b511-4e80a8efcb53-1
01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:09.138
every sector would be using the
digital media more and more is

40c5f32d-3f60-411b-b511-4e80a8efcb53-2
01:08:09.138 --> 01:08:12.803
now going to get exposed more
and more. So as we keep

40c5f32d-3f60-411b-b511-4e80a8efcb53-3
01:08:12.803 --> 01:08:16.943
developing into them, I think we
need to keep looking at the

40c5f32d-3f60-411b-b511-4e80a8efcb53-4
01:08:16.943 --> 01:08:20.540
security aspects even more so
perhaps at some stage.

82740ecc-889c-4673-a4ea-5aeeb79a9063-0
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:26.351
As we enter it, the security
aspect needs to be taken first

82740ecc-889c-4673-a4ea-5aeeb79a9063-1
01:08:26.351 --> 01:08:30.758
into consideration and therefore
needs to be given its due

82740ecc-889c-4673-a4ea-5aeeb79a9063-2
01:08:30.758 --> 01:08:35.688
importance. Otherwise the system
itself compromised at a critical

82740ecc-889c-4673-a4ea-5aeeb79a9063-3
01:08:35.688 --> 01:08:39.946
time means the system has no
meaning. It loses its value

82740ecc-889c-4673-a4ea-5aeeb79a9063-4
01:08:39.946 --> 01:08:43.980
within seconds after an after an
attack of this kind.

a8072d39-d132-496b-802c-fe638b02d7b8-0
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:45.360
So.

8dcd5585-4f1e-4e2c-83e6-2fdc919f08d5-0
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.820
Um, certainly. Uh, I can bring
out that.

e03b03aa-06c2-4303-9f68-903cce52a4b0-0
01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:54.360
During the uh Ukraine war.

e79fe97d-e9f5-4a6a-b283-5358b89e479f-0
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:57.930
What we are quite certain about
is that.

d3eaf4dc-5415-47e7-b650-1170a146affb-0
01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:01.760
It was the Kinetic War was
preceded by.

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-0
01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.434
As a series of cyber attacks to
bring down information

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-1
01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:11.731
infrastructure off of the
Ukrainians by the Russians, and

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-2
01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:16.472
although the narrative is more
from the US side, I dare say not

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-3
01:09:16.472 --> 01:09:20.695
only was it protected more by
the US, but also they were

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-4
01:09:20.695 --> 01:09:25.288
offensive attacks by the US as
well. Now, did that hit health

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-5
01:09:25.288 --> 01:09:29.659
infrastructure? I'm not sure
about that, but will it help?

f2c6c5a6-4a04-4bff-b0c7-89a6351d5087-6
01:09:29.659 --> 01:09:33.289
Will it hit health
infrastructure in the future?

e15a11f5-ba0d-40b1-8c0b-da961d6327aa-0
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.180
I'm sure book.

72e3ed32-8cab-4a14-b2ea-050c17898dbd-0
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:39.259
So, um, maybe, as was brought
out in the introductory remarks

72e3ed32-8cab-4a14-b2ea-050c17898dbd-1
01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:43.404
by Kanishk himself, maybe we are
heading towards health sector

72e3ed32-8cab-4a14-b2ea-050c17898dbd-2
01:09:43.404 --> 01:09:47.089
becoming one of the critical
information infrastructure

72e3ed32-8cab-4a14-b2ea-050c17898dbd-3
01:09:47.089 --> 01:09:47.550
issues.

a37b6a14-e055-4452-874b-dd9c1e029057-0
01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:53.532
Now the the United States
defense forces have also now

a37b6a14-e055-4452-874b-dd9c1e029057-1
01:09:53.532 --> 01:09:58.208
begun to look at the cloud as a
vulnerability. Where the cloud

a37b6a14-e055-4452-874b-dd9c1e029057-2
01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:02.439
is a big enabler. They have
started looking at their own

a37b6a14-e055-4452-874b-dd9c1e029057-3
01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:07.190
cloud as a vulnerability and are
trying to bring in regulation.

1e6c84b5-2cc2-47c1-84b4-a5b2b2621ba4-0
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:11.203
Now if you're bringing in
regulation to protect your

1e6c84b5-2cc2-47c1-84b4-a5b2b2621ba4-1
01:10:11.203 --> 01:10:15.212
cloud, that is 1 aspect which
which the GC would definitely be

1e6c84b5-2cc2-47c1-84b4-a5b2b2621ba4-2
01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:18.777
able to throw light upon. But is
that a physical way of

1e6c84b5-2cc2-47c1-84b4-a5b2b2621ba4-3
01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:20.050
protecting yourself?

904e7454-746a-442d-9271-e6ef2ea8e8fe-0
01:10:21.210 --> 01:10:25.919
Maybe certain measures will have
to be enforced by cloud managers

904e7454-746a-442d-9271-e6ef2ea8e8fe-1
01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:30.485
and uh by cloud holders to make
sure that uh, the cloud is safe

904e7454-746a-442d-9271-e6ef2ea8e8fe-2
01:10:30.485 --> 01:10:35.051
for everyone. And this brings us
to a very critical uh thing in

904e7454-746a-442d-9271-e6ef2ea8e8fe-3
01:10:35.051 --> 01:10:35.480
India.

a0d564e4-7189-44e3-958a-184fd4d2dba2-0
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:41.147
Are we now looking at cloud to
keep our data whether it is

a0d564e4-7189-44e3-958a-184fd4d2dba2-1
01:10:41.147 --> 01:10:45.570
health data which is getting
more and more sensitive than it

a0d564e4-7189-44e3-958a-184fd4d2dba2-2
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:48.180
was before or is it any other
data?

89a82d49-93ef-4256-802c-703bbc5c298b-0
01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:53.949
And for that, should we base it
on AI based cloud rather than

89a82d49-93ef-4256-802c-703bbc5c298b-1
01:10:53.949 --> 01:10:57.940
just a cloud and then start
adding things to it?

7d9dc350-b1b0-4c31-a928-4e0ba07fdc8f-0
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:04.114
My my take would be that we need
to have a cloud architecture

7d9dc350-b1b0-4c31-a928-4e0ba07fdc8f-1
01:11:04.114 --> 01:11:05.800
which is more discrete.

df0c5b3a-9f15-4ed1-a343-ccfdaed3e2a2-0
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.366
I mean a segregated cloud which
brings data together when

df0c5b3a-9f15-4ed1-a343-ccfdaed3e2a2-1
01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:15.801
required and by only those
people who have authorization to

df0c5b3a-9f15-4ed1-a343-ccfdaed3e2a2-2
01:11:15.801 --> 01:11:19.793
bring it together. That itself
will give you a lot of

df0c5b3a-9f15-4ed1-a343-ccfdaed3e2a2-3
01:11:19.793 --> 01:11:24.301
protection for not only defense
forces, but all the other uh

df0c5b3a-9f15-4ed1-a343-ccfdaed3e2a2-4
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:25.780
departments as well.

a2ae0b09-44ed-4287-adb6-17b074f7aeeb-0
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:27.590
Um.

6fc39e54-e896-4f27-859f-1ce8ede6fbd5-0
01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:32.078
I I found that a little
interesting where you both

6fc39e54-e896-4f27-859f-1ce8ede6fbd5-1
01:11:32.078 --> 01:11:36.368
remarked on, you know, somebody
intervening at a critical stage

6fc39e54-e896-4f27-859f-1ce8ede6fbd5-2
01:11:36.368 --> 01:11:40.591
in a robotic surgery. Now that
would be a really real time and

6fc39e54-e896-4f27-859f-1ce8ede6fbd5-3
01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:42.870
would need a very high degree
of.

42551937-1ddd-4c95-805c-999343883d7b-0
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.730
No penetration to be able to
affect that.

03b9a2fc-2c1b-4394-b3ec-11dbddd8082f-0
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.170
But that could possibly come in
in the future. And uh, it would

03b9a2fc-2c1b-4394-b3ec-11dbddd8082f-1
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:54.510
be useful only for.

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-0
01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:59.365
Critical surgeries for critical
people maybe where somebody

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-1
01:11:59.365 --> 01:12:03.044
might like to interview.
Absolutely. So they remain as an

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-2
01:12:03.044 --> 01:12:06.406
app and you know you keep
getting data and only at a

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-3
01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:10.275
critical juncture. It's more
like an assassination attempt I

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-4
01:12:10.275 --> 01:12:14.081
would say you either kill a man
by a bullet or you kill him

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-5
01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:17.760
during his own surgery. So it's
it's something like that.

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-6
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:21.883
Otherwise yes to create general
havoc. I I agree that could that

7e8bc298-ff7c-4db7-bd43-7bd38583dcee-7
01:12:21.883 --> 01:12:26.070
could create a sense of you know
disarray amongst the population.

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-0
01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:29.855
And deny a lot of services to
the population. So that sounds

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-1
01:12:29.855 --> 01:12:33.362
in the future also something
that will have to be protected

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-2
01:12:33.362 --> 01:12:36.460
on a, on a, on a, you know,
population on a complete

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-3
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.909
population basis, but not
really. I don't see it coming up

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-4
01:12:39.909 --> 01:12:43.650
very much. Now we have to start
working towards it. No doubt. I

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-5
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:47.391
totally agree with you. So with
these thoughts, I leave it back

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-6
01:12:47.391 --> 01:12:50.489
to kanishk. Yeah, maybe I'll
come in a little. Yeah.

684b45b7-dc78-477a-adbe-62659158a963-7
01:12:50.489 --> 01:12:53.120
Terrence, you know, make any
point on cloud?

ef1e7d1c-ded9-4f6d-97b1-50f4d3c45205-0
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:58.999
Are we looking for more hybrid
cloud options? Uh, you know,

ef1e7d1c-ded9-4f6d-97b1-50f4d3c45205-1
01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:03.276
taking learnings from what
happened in Ukraine, uh, right,

ef1e7d1c-ded9-4f6d-97b1-50f4d3c45205-2
01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:07.697
whether there were physical
attacks on data centers and then

ef1e7d1c-ded9-4f6d-97b1-50f4d3c45205-3
01:13:07.697 --> 01:13:10.380
the entire system was shut down,
so.

bea160e5-0dd9-466d-82c5-9ebe1168c613-0
01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:14.930
Do we require more systems than
we saw companies like Palantir

bea160e5-0dd9-466d-82c5-9ebe1168c613-1
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.680
actually use AI on top of the
data clouds that were being set

bea160e5-0dd9-466d-82c5-9ebe1168c613-2
01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.890
up. Yeah. Thank you.

e841608c-39c0-40df-bbed-0acd6a729f1f-0
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:23.840
Yeah. Yeah, sure. And I think
that.

f4f8667b-3d06-42e5-a890-667e3868e614-0
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.240
The way to look at this is like.

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-0
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:31.649
When you look at cloud, you know
inherently there's a general

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-1
01:13:31.649 --> 01:13:35.073
feeling that OK, what's the
security of cloud? Is my data

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-2
01:13:35.073 --> 01:13:38.910
safe? Is my infrastructure safe?
What are the, what are the pros

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-3
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:42.510
and cons of it? I would say
you'll have to take a, you know,

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-4
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:46.347
you'll have to take a calculated
approach for the as you look at

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-5
01:13:46.347 --> 01:13:50.007
the cloud. For example, in the
Ukraine situation, right if if

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-6
01:13:50.007 --> 01:13:53.549
the attacks were on physical
data centers and there were no

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-7
01:13:53.549 --> 01:13:57.149
backups, so there was no apps,
services that were running in

f76684bf-fed3-4399-8953-da222fd41a23-8
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.740
the cloud.

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-0
01:13:57.990 --> 01:14:01.301
Uh, data centers that were
physically there in the in a

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-1
01:14:01.301 --> 01:14:05.027
specific location, if they were
under attack through through a

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-2
01:14:05.027 --> 01:14:08.693
physical warfare mechanism that
would also render the digital

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-3
01:14:08.693 --> 01:14:12.242
services you know to be not
available and that would become

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-4
01:14:12.242 --> 01:14:15.731
another. You know that the
direct attack on the technology

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-5
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:19.515
infrastructure. But at the same
time if you have a backup or if

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-6
01:14:19.515 --> 01:14:23.300
you have your disaster recovery
or your Dr. plan running in the

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-7
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.612
cloud and as you know cloud
service providers, the data

8e4d47ee-0cba-459a-9e0a-956e5157492b-8
01:14:26.612 --> 01:14:28.150
centers, the regions, the.

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-0
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:32.875
The all of this is not known in
in you know in the in the public

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-1
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:37.429
domain so in a way you can you
know it also enables you to have

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-2
01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:41.628
either ADR or an availability
zone and and creates still a

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-3
01:14:41.628 --> 01:14:45.613
backup for your whether it's
critical infrastructure or

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-4
01:14:45.613 --> 01:14:49.740
whether it is for this business
applications. I would say

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-5
01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.583
depending on how you look at
risk and how you want to

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-6
01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:57.781
mitigate it. Cloud can be a
primary option. Cloud can be a

cb4d3ad9-417d-4d74-a5df-16cd7c852398-7
01:14:57.781 --> 01:14:58.280
backup.

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-0
01:14:58.350 --> 01:15:02.851
Option cloud can be a hybrid
option. Now come into the second

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-1
01:15:02.851 --> 01:15:07.062
concern which is generally
they're saying OK while I look

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-2
01:15:07.062 --> 01:15:11.708
at cloud as as my secure as my
alternative for my physical data

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-3
01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:15.847
center and to address the
availability issues. How can I

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-4
01:15:15.847 --> 01:15:20.203
you know trust cloud and this
cloud safe? And is is my data

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-5
01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:24.123
secure? I think Azure service
provider for example at

e8c36fe5-e0c9-493c-a295-d9f4b5be1381-6
01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:24.850
Microsoft.

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-0
01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:30.270
We definitely do a lot of
knowledge sharing, do a lot of

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-1
01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:34.980
yeah, I would say visibility
into how Microsoft secures cloud

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-2
01:15:34.980 --> 01:15:38.854
and not just like by sharing
information, but also

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-3
01:15:38.854 --> 01:15:42.957
participating and enlisting
ourselves for third party

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-4
01:15:42.957 --> 01:15:47.743
audits, certifications like for
example the Microsoft Cloud is

5874db0d-92f3-48bc-b2f0-5be994db11c9-5
01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:51.009
part of the mighty empanelment,
right? So.

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-0
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.590
The cloud service provider. So I
think it's it's also not just

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-1
01:15:56.590 --> 01:16:00.580
being being sharing of knowledge
but also getting sort of tied

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-2
01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:04.381
and and you know being audited
and sharing how you know the

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-3
01:16:04.381 --> 01:16:08.245
cloud is safe and secure and
building that element of trust.

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-4
01:16:08.245 --> 01:16:12.108
So I think it's it's it's a two
way St. sharing of knowledge

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-5
01:16:12.108 --> 01:16:15.972
sharing of information showing
how what are the steps that a

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-6
01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:19.646
cloud service provider like
Microsoft is taking to ensure

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-7
01:16:19.646 --> 01:16:23.319
the security of the digital
goods as well as the physical

55e820cf-c9f2-4e02-9a74-4c46b1415e83-8
01:16:23.319 --> 01:16:23.700
goods.

60b769c1-9a16-44c4-8c85-de0a24f9251f-0
01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:27.529
In their in their data center
and creating more like a hybrid

60b769c1-9a16-44c4-8c85-de0a24f9251f-1
01:16:27.529 --> 01:16:31.319
approach to an organization in
case they were physically under

60b769c1-9a16-44c4-8c85-de0a24f9251f-2
01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:35.048
attack or even digitally under
attack in case of a ransomware

60b769c1-9a16-44c4-8c85-de0a24f9251f-3
01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:35.649
situation.

637a39f3-74fe-4999-98ed-4711b625ea94-0
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:39.090
Thank you.

7b1c4b95-5ee8-4d57-9c52-7da2032948dc-0
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:41.040
Mr. ministry.

88980b9a-83e0-41d7-ab4b-26068572b89c-0
01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.536
Would want to get your views.
You know we have been discussing

88980b9a-83e0-41d7-ab4b-26068572b89c-1
01:16:46.536 --> 01:16:50.639
on enhancing India's cyber laws
and you know there was some work

88980b9a-83e0-41d7-ab4b-26068572b89c-2
01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:54.804
which was done particularly with
respect to making changes in the

88980b9a-83e0-41d7-ab4b-26068572b89c-3
01:16:54.804 --> 01:16:58.465
Indian IT act. We saw the
certain rules come in. However,

88980b9a-83e0-41d7-ab4b-26068572b89c-4
01:16:58.465 --> 01:17:00.170
what we see so far is that.

76b919fb-d356-4934-adcd-c1ac73e3e56e-0
01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:04.773
Be healthcare ecosystem, not
just healthcare but the entire

76b919fb-d356-4934-adcd-c1ac73e3e56e-1
01:17:04.773 --> 01:17:08.296
ecosystem which includes
pharmacy which holds so much

76b919fb-d356-4934-adcd-c1ac73e3e56e-2
01:17:08.296 --> 01:17:11.883
amount of our PII personal
identifiable information if

76b919fb-d356-4934-adcd-c1ac73e3e56e-3
01:17:11.883 --> 01:17:12.210
they.

5a3c9a39-dda8-4742-aec1-f02442b8d64d-0
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:15.030
Lose the data.

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-0
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:20.187
There is no liability, there's
no penalty. Most of the chief

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-1
01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:24.512
information security officers
which who have been appointed

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-2
01:17:24.512 --> 01:17:29.126
have been appointed keeping in
global regulations and not India

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-3
01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:33.523
regulations per se. And we also
see a heavy use of IoT based

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-4
01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:37.704
systems. We see heavy use of AI
also. They are AI enabled

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-5
01:17:37.704 --> 01:17:41.813
systems which are being used,
chat bots being put up, so

d4e20390-cd70-4aa5-be0c-0422ad7c7ff8-6
01:17:41.813 --> 01:17:42.390
overall.

af5a774e-a1f1-403a-b8d8-530761cbe4b3-0
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.153
Taking learnings from the aims
attack, Rob, what are some of

af5a774e-a1f1-403a-b8d8-530761cbe4b3-1
01:17:47.153 --> 01:17:50.983
the things that Government of
India could do to enhance the

af5a774e-a1f1-403a-b8d8-530761cbe4b3-2
01:17:50.983 --> 01:17:54.750
safety and security of the
health care ecosystem in India?

9a891f6d-24ad-4a7a-87d7-b97c4e9b441e-0
01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.020
Thank you, kanishk.

32b15965-a75a-47da-a31f-2195a169e79d-0
01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.600
First of all.

740fd3b4-5543-44de-9f98-87c509bd2348-0
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:04.430
Let me convey that.

a4c1a994-51de-4000-8191-2126606ae71c-0
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:07.940
In respect of the existing IT
act.

fdf85fb7-85cb-48eb-91c1-6f716452594a-0
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.560
There are.

ce5165df-9f4e-44fb-ab73-889cfd3b83aa-0
01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:16.522
Two sections which exclusively
deal with the cyber security

ce5165df-9f4e-44fb-ab73-889cfd3b83aa-1
01:18:16.522 --> 01:18:17.170
aspects.

47d69f77-5fa3-48ed-b98c-f9d56688c1a3-0
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.979
One of in fact, two of them are
with respect to creation of the

47d69f77-5fa3-48ed-b98c-f9d56688c1a3-1
01:18:22.979 --> 01:18:26.147
specialized institutions,
particularly the computer

47d69f77-5fa3-48ed-b98c-f9d56688c1a3-2
01:18:26.147 --> 01:18:27.610
emergency response team.

eb9bc47d-0d43-42ec-8d06-f4ce8120cdda-0
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:33.590
Indian Computer Emergency
Response team as well as NCIC

eb9bc47d-0d43-42ec-8d06-f4ce8120cdda-1
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:36.170
for critical infrastructure.

058bc33a-43f1-4662-8bf8-a8fb7c8c99a3-0
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.730
There is Section 70 also I mean
which.

dfbf6fa9-3870-4c9c-8491-cae04be5eb90-0
01:18:42.450 --> 01:18:47.294
In addition to I mean creating
these two infrastructure, I mean

dfbf6fa9-3870-4c9c-8491-cae04be5eb90-1
01:18:47.294 --> 01:18:51.230
which which provides for
declaration of a critical.

b0e63a9e-978e-4b91-b962-57e387f159c4-0
01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:54.200
Information infrastructure.

9f3163f0-dca5-4f57-88ff-2b85f44e898c-0
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:55.740
To be.

dd3b103b-0788-4029-bd5a-265133de3d91-0
01:18:56.850 --> 01:19:01.360
Notified and once notified it is
called as protected system.

6dd70d96-77cd-40c7-8f83-67b97dd3c163-0
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:04.720
And the whole idea of
notification.

717c7ce5-3d93-4516-8a63-3284904a1757-0
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:08.760
Is that one the organization?

e38822aa-22c0-4f80-9a34-8b6b4a665f76-0
01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:14.830
Carries out a detailed risk
analysis of what exactly is

e38822aa-22c0-4f80-9a34-8b6b4a665f76-1
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:16.290
critical with them.

8ee3d749-1f09-4952-b0b8-db7b83ec1aea-0
01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.470
And.

537a9f38-37fe-4c59-a58d-46a2b8c8c89d-0
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:21.751
Critical here means
unavailability of which will

537a9f38-37fe-4c59-a58d-46a2b8c8c89d-1
01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:22.780
have a impact.

6e9ced7e-938f-423e-84a3-051260ff5b3b-0
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:24.720
At a national level.

b75549f5-74ee-479c-83aa-be7b7cc055b2-0
01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.340
Either in terms of economy or in
terms of public health.

cb3cc7e5-0b69-402c-b48d-34a17d7f155f-0
01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:36.125
Or there is one more term. Maybe
I'm not, not immediately. I'm in

cb3cc7e5-0b69-402c-b48d-34a17d7f155f-1
01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:39.390
getting it, but the impact is at
a national level.

5217ff5d-9cdc-4ea1-a30c-e2da94e9a124-0
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:44.129
And to that an extent, NCC not
only I mean works for

5217ff5d-9cdc-4ea1-a30c-e2da94e9a124-1
01:19:44.129 --> 01:19:48.207
identifying the critical
information infrastructure, it

5217ff5d-9cdc-4ea1-a30c-e2da94e9a124-2
01:19:48.207 --> 01:19:49.300
also works for.

f6fe69a3-72ce-4cca-94e7-35569b5961c1-0
01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:51.770
Identifying critical.

1739e7cb-bab4-47ae-a135-9846b1a740c7-0
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:53.500
Sectors.

508440cd-a7f6-444c-9fc6-1e6e0dec7451-0
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.902
And particularly post COVID
health sector has already been

508440cd-a7f6-444c-9fc6-1e6e0dec7451-1
01:19:58.902 --> 01:20:01.420
identified as a critical sector.

032133b9-6467-41fd-a880-76232c72f7f2-0
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.600
And as of today, if you look at.

21483233-ee00-4107-a8d9-f49c6efff1e5-0
01:20:06.370 --> 01:20:10.960
Almost every week we are
notifying one or other.

9150da9e-34f1-429e-a193-cd41d172fed8-0
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.972
Identified infrastructure as the
critical in, I mean as as the

9150da9e-34f1-429e-a193-cd41d172fed8-1
01:20:17.972 --> 01:20:21.466
protected system, so being
notified as protected systems

9150da9e-34f1-429e-a193-cd41d172fed8-2
01:20:21.466 --> 01:20:22.570
so. So that's one.

ea4ca8f3-a113-4dc9-8369-92e445aa585b-0
01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:26.060
2nd is.

2b1c27d8-9346-454b-9778-7385cdb7a48d-0
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.830
Of course from Government of
India side.

3ccea4cf-9e0c-4802-9216-e5aed622d428-0
01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.410
There had always been a.

c7b73112-4e0e-4776-8a4e-a6b67c42c2f8-0
01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:37.981
A constant effort. The Cisos are
appointed in all government

c7b73112-4e0e-4776-8a4e-a6b67c42c2f8-1
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:42.583
organizations and the intent is
not that it is. It has to be

c7b73112-4e0e-4776-8a4e-a6b67c42c2f8-2
01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:47.260
with respect to all government
organizations. In fact, if you

c7b73112-4e0e-4776-8a4e-a6b67c42c2f8-3
01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.862
look at the the other part of
the IT Act, which is primarily

c7b73112-4e0e-4776-8a4e-a6b67c42c2f8-4
01:20:51.862 --> 01:20:53.220
about Section 43A.

0d3eea9e-9a54-48a9-a142-8ff50e556df9-0
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.767
Which deals with sensitive
personal data or information and

0d3eea9e-9a54-48a9-a142-8ff50e556df9-1
01:20:57.767 --> 01:21:01.787
protection of sensitive data,
personal data or information. It

0d3eea9e-9a54-48a9-a142-8ff50e556df9-2
01:21:01.787 --> 01:21:05.168
also talks about anybody
corporate which is which is

0d3eea9e-9a54-48a9-a142-8ff50e556df9-3
01:21:05.168 --> 01:21:05.870
processing.

de8dacb7-b0e3-41be-9533-ef43169bedf8-0
01:21:06.610 --> 01:21:08.960
The sensitive personal data in
any way.

e06407ec-d2db-4b57-846b-05dd488ae1dc-0
01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:14.174
And when I say processing means,
I mean in the entire lifecycle

e06407ec-d2db-4b57-846b-05dd488ae1dc-1
01:21:14.174 --> 01:21:17.284
of the data is starting from
collection to storage to

e06407ec-d2db-4b57-846b-05dd488ae1dc-2
01:21:17.284 --> 01:21:19.759
processing to analyze to to
maybe finally.

83b06a99-d695-408e-89d4-b323ede92bde-0
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.570
Archiving and disposal.

a7088d50-5b31-493a-952f-b128a6fd4571-0
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.850
The the body corporate is
mandated.

d31672c7-aa9d-466d-930e-8a6b82229726-0
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.530
To ensure a reasonable degree of
security.

e5d7c2b2-e935-4145-8447-db6d0c2c6213-0
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:35.850
And if I look at the spdi rules,
which not only mandate the

e5d7c2b2-e935-4145-8447-db6d0c2c6213-1
01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:40.552
existence of a privacy policy,
but also mention that in order

e5d7c2b2-e935-4145-8447-db6d0c2c6213-2
01:21:40.552 --> 01:21:44.571
to to to ensure and in order to
demonstrate that the

e5d7c2b2-e935-4145-8447-db6d0c2c6213-3
01:21:44.571 --> 01:21:48.894
organization is doing the
reasonable or is following the

e5d7c2b2-e935-4145-8447-db6d0c2c6213-4
01:21:48.894 --> 01:21:51.170
reasonable security practices.

dbf40bbf-1f1d-4106-9023-83cf5f316537-0
01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:58.346
It recommends that the
organization should comply with

dbf40bbf-1f1d-4106-9023-83cf5f316537-1
01:21:58.346 --> 01:21:59.480
ISO 27,001.

f70278bc-fe92-4730-bb43-962402a1c1be-0
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:04.877
Which means a good information
security management system

f70278bc-fe92-4730-bb43-962402a1c1be-1
01:22:04.877 --> 01:22:06.360
should be in place.

2345d4a3-5674-4831-a69d-99e35ed4e881-0
01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:13.220
So while for example certain
already uh, I mean it comes out

2345d4a3-5674-4831-a69d-99e35ed4e881-1
01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:17.321
with day-to-day vulnerability
notes with day-to-day

2345d4a3-5674-4831-a69d-99e35ed4e881-2
01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:21.895
advisories, it provided a
comprehensive set of directions

2345d4a3-5674-4831-a69d-99e35ed4e881-3
01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.630
on 28th of April 2022.

126579ec-ff2f-4939-aa22-4b62871f7ed6-0
01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.440
And one of the learning that we
had.

e2205b4b-f68e-4fd7-969f-17843f7c08b5-0
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:32.780
Based on the IMS incident, is
that maybe?

8662413a-2af8-4b1e-b0ca-3ddd4636625c-0
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:37.344
While while we are talking of
having the, I mean the CISOS in

8662413a-2af8-4b1e-b0ca-3ddd4636625c-1
01:22:37.344 --> 01:22:40.715
every government organizations,
while we are asking every

8662413a-2af8-4b1e-b0ca-3ddd4636625c-2
01:22:40.715 --> 01:22:42.750
government organization to have
a.

00e7cdd6-e058-4f67-9c73-ecff53303720-0
01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.790
Business continuity plan?

e736f90a-ccec-452c-bed7-727f32913182-0
01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:50.310
Certain is coming out.

7c5c2f5e-abdd-428e-997d-a2eb689f308c-0
01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:54.820
Shortly with a detailed
guideline.

634baf25-d18f-4905-893d-25ceb18fe5e2-0
01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:00.626
In respect of of course, all
government organizations and

634baf25-d18f-4905-893d-25ceb18fe5e2-1
01:23:00.626 --> 01:23:05.223
technically, I mean actually it
will mean for all, all

634baf25-d18f-4905-893d-25ceb18fe5e2-2
01:23:05.223 --> 01:23:10.070
organizations in the country as
to what kind of controls.

40dbccfa-1c6e-4bfd-88dc-f289b72da422-0
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.129
Should be in place whether they
are technical, whether they are

40dbccfa-1c6e-4bfd-88dc-f289b72da422-1
01:23:15.129 --> 01:23:19.151
organizational or whether they
are process oriented. So, so

40dbccfa-1c6e-4bfd-88dc-f289b72da422-2
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:23.039
detailed guidelines are being
worked out and shall be out

40dbccfa-1c6e-4bfd-88dc-f289b72da422-3
01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:26.190
shortly. I mean from from
certain perspective.

e6057d2d-2c52-4f68-98fb-936d87abad6c-0
01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.484
I would also like to say, I mean
going beyond what is stated in

e6057d2d-2c52-4f68-98fb-936d87abad6c-1
01:23:32.484 --> 01:23:34.700
the law, I would also like to
say that.

ce66d0e7-605d-4c26-bc31-5b4eaa1d4c36-0
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:43.549
From uh in order to have, I
should say, secure products in

ce66d0e7-605d-4c26-bc31-5b4eaa1d4c36-1
01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:44.190
place.

03ead5b2-3739-48c3-9b62-993a84f2c089-0
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:50.529
As TQC, which is also part of
Ministry of Information and I

03ead5b2-3739-48c3-9b62-993a84f2c089-1
01:23:50.529 --> 01:23:54.962
Ministry of Electronics and
Information Technology, SQC

03ead5b2-3739-48c3-9b62-993a84f2c089-2
01:23:54.962 --> 01:23:59.949
Directorate is already working
on and is the national body for

03ead5b2-3739-48c3-9b62-993a84f2c089-3
01:23:59.949 --> 01:24:02.719
the common criteria
certification.

e7042ca5-36d1-4dbf-bfee-0fe1491c10f3-0
01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:09.374
I'm sure about 20 different
products have already been

e7042ca5-36d1-4dbf-bfee-0fe1491c10f3-1
01:24:09.374 --> 01:24:11.270
tested and certified by them.

48a4c992-0b8a-4e42-a685-45130d7a4e27-0
01:24:11.970 --> 01:24:12.970
To qualify.

fbbe9c17-65d4-401e-8471-0d62e59ae9ab-0
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:17.810
At different, I should say uh,
assessment level.

0d8a6423-935d-4a00-9de6-9523070fec05-0
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:21.110
As the CC certified products.

95af75d9-0ed3-4ab1-a47b-bbddca75a9fa-0
01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:27.750
The country needs more and more
such capability in the country.

1a56bba6-c317-4112-aee2-bbfeb123f454-0
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:33.780
And to that an extent, we also
have, uh, software.

88e12b0b-9e90-4ed0-9750-47031928c6d7-0
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.386
I mean, we also have an
empanelment scheme for software

88e12b0b-9e90-4ed0-9750-47031928c6d7-1
01:24:38.386 --> 01:24:42.060
testing laboratories. So it's
not just about the products

88e12b0b-9e90-4ed0-9750-47031928c6d7-2
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.480
which need to be tested, but we
also need to have the

88e12b0b-9e90-4ed0-9750-47031928c6d7-3
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:49.216
laboratories, reasonably good
number of laboratories to be

88e12b0b-9e90-4ed0-9750-47031928c6d7-4
01:24:49.216 --> 01:24:51.560
able to test such products in
India.

e69a8981-c6bd-41af-abe2-e7a22779039f-0
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.707
And on both these accounts SQC
is already working. So I'll say

e69a8981-c6bd-41af-abe2-e7a22779039f-1
01:24:57.707 --> 01:24:58.110
that.

5ba12c18-d1ee-42a8-833f-6ef37e3ea107-0
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.950
1.

816fee68-f995-4509-9a6d-b3e3aa8e9fbb-0
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:05.070
The existing IT law already has
certain provisions.

ff373c15-e97c-4ac2-bf02-3b23a4b6a7a8-0
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.250
2.

4294fd60-c12c-4313-861d-08e0b95ffa16-0
01:25:07.710 --> 01:25:11.768
The The government already have,
I should say, a well defined

4294fd60-c12c-4313-861d-08e0b95ffa16-1
01:25:11.768 --> 01:25:15.826
structure and well recognized
internationally well recognized

4294fd60-c12c-4313-861d-08e0b95ffa16-2
01:25:15.826 --> 01:25:17.070
structure in place.

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-0
01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:21.511
Three, almost every government
organization, I mean so. So

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-1
01:25:21.511 --> 01:25:25.172
while security is required by
everybody, of course, I mean

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-2
01:25:25.172 --> 01:25:28.833
being in government, our domain
is primarily to is to also

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-3
01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:32.245
ensure that government
organizations remain secure and

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-4
01:25:32.245 --> 01:25:35.720
to that an extent, whatever is
necessary for government

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-5
01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.257
organizations to be secure,
proactive measures are being

bab7a037-f025-4014-a060-9a9817dd6de3-6
01:25:39.257 --> 01:25:39.629
taken.

fd234165-a28c-42f4-a051-8bffea9d6968-0
01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:41.730
So.

58023234-135c-497e-abda-50aebbb92c30-0
01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:47.059
From a from a policy
perspective, these things are

58023234-135c-497e-abda-50aebbb92c30-1
01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:51.361
already in place and in the new
Digital India Act that we are

58023234-135c-497e-abda-50aebbb92c30-2
01:25:51.361 --> 01:25:53.859
talking of a comprehensive view
of.

6c0905ca-7154-4823-81b1-2fed6f373b8d-0
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:58.347
What the security structure? I
mean security policy of the

6c0905ca-7154-4823-81b1-2fed6f373b8d-1
01:25:58.347 --> 01:26:01.340
organizations, I mean of the
country should be.

cab2fe0b-9a05-4fd7-9e62-7384db2e4bd2-0
01:26:02.150 --> 01:26:05.520
Including maybe possibilities of
having.

35c472be-c20f-48d4-b56b-0de8f935a373-0
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:09.930
More sectoral and state level
certs.

85f6a412-275c-426d-9857-20bd80e67d71-0
01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:14.939
Coordination between these
sectoral and state level certs.

85f6a412-275c-426d-9857-20bd80e67d71-1
01:26:14.939 --> 01:26:16.700
Visive is the national cert.

a5586e9c-3d4c-4467-ad90-f6a25e4c58c3-0
01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.800
Ability to create standards in
the area of cybersecurity.

00a48bd4-6183-46bb-97f2-6db618612f3a-0
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:24.810
And ability to test.

f07d8ebf-07fe-4a3e-b8f3-21b44c16263c-0
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.020
Cyber security products and
systems.

2f7ab985-72ab-4d49-830b-557e427daaf1-0
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:30.930
Is being envisaged so.

8340ce00-a4c3-42b2-a838-26765c458c72-0
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.857
These are some of the
initiatives in the existing and

8340ce00-a4c3-42b2-a838-26765c458c72-1
01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:38.110
the potential IT act and the and
from the government side.

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-0
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:45.011
Thank you, Mr. Maheshwari. So we
also have yeah, Doctor Debra,

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-1
01:26:45.011 --> 01:26:49.273
please go ahead. I just have a
humble request to our honorable

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-2
01:26:49.273 --> 01:26:52.994
speaker that ISO 27001 is a very
good regulation to be

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-3
01:26:52.994 --> 01:26:56.512
implemented and to it is a
process oriented kind of

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-4
01:26:56.512 --> 01:27:00.841
implementation in the healthcare
system. If we have implemented

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-5
01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:05.103
227799 which is actually been
designed for to take care of the

dea59038-c795-4c30-93fd-cb58d947d2f5-6
01:27:05.103 --> 01:27:08.080
health data that could be an
very good Sir.

ec768e7c-f5ce-43a0-9aef-fc12ebddd223-0
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.500
So so.

152a2f8e-8342-4451-8739-1b2ab9dad652-0
01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:16.365
In addition to isms, because ISS
today, if you look at the

152a2f8e-8342-4451-8739-1b2ab9dad652-1
01:27:16.365 --> 01:27:20.626
development of ISO 27,001 and
related standards, in fact,

152a2f8e-8342-4451-8739-1b2ab9dad652-2
01:27:20.626 --> 01:27:22.170
security and privacy.

450cff6f-2fd1-45c7-bf04-2297a614a28e-0
01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:26.427
Or or lower security and data
protection for that reason are

450cff6f-2fd1-45c7-bf04-2297a614a28e-1
01:27:26.427 --> 01:27:26.860
merging.

1200faf0-dc3c-4e44-aea8-1e5daf870d2c-0
01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:30.190
There is a convergence of these
two things.

79c9410f-0a48-4d6b-97bc-460e081bc2cd-0
01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:34.130
So from once again from
government perspective.

31c568f2-f4f8-47d7-913a-a364993455da-0
01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:38.866
Government is already working on
the digital data protection

31c568f2-f4f8-47d7-913a-a364993455da-1
01:27:38.866 --> 01:27:39.170
bill.

3eb920eb-b36d-4040-85b0-8c05b3bddebe-0
01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:45.364
And if things go well, very
soon, the the we we already had

3eb920eb-b36d-4040-85b0-8c05b3bddebe-1
01:27:45.364 --> 01:27:50.980
gone in for public consultation
of the DP, DP bill, which was on

3eb920eb-b36d-4040-85b0-8c05b3bddebe-2
01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.190
November 2022.

de930506-6797-4769-ba85-c5aede45b716-0
01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:56.847
Hopefully in time to come you
will see the bill going to the

de930506-6797-4769-ba85-c5aede45b716-1
01:27:56.847 --> 01:28:01.053
Parliament there after of course
it's the call of the Parliament

de930506-6797-4769-ba85-c5aede45b716-2
01:28:01.053 --> 01:28:05.129
to be to be able to take, but I
do agree that 27,001 remains a

de930506-6797-4769-ba85-c5aede45b716-3
01:28:05.129 --> 01:28:06.230
generic standard.

a880d3ad-5519-4e19-8c7b-21ffe4a4c48f-0
01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.708
Has to be supplemented by the
sector sector specific

a880d3ad-5519-4e19-8c7b-21ffe4a4c48f-1
01:28:11.708 --> 01:28:12.760
requirements.

faa762f4-1c03-4198-8909-b2e20ffcd98f-0
01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:17.636
Though it is a process standard,
it does talk of it does talk of

faa762f4-1c03-4198-8909-b2e20ffcd98f-1
01:28:17.636 --> 01:28:21.630
understanding the risks of the
corresponding I mean industry.

20f06368-1b76-481d-a2f4-0becd5a0829f-0
01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:25.910
Corresponding or organization
and based on which.

2167304d-8bf9-4882-afc6-487b897f0c91-0
01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.130
Whatever is considered to be
necessary control.

b5153053-65c9-4142-be79-3b211fb2b92c-0
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:34.857
Not just process, but also
people. Also technology. So it

b5153053-65c9-4142-be79-3b211fb2b92c-1
01:28:34.857 --> 01:28:37.700
it, it's a it's a convergence of
all three.

c64003cc-c033-44f7-8b54-9ae614ae4071-0
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:44.378
This one slide slide down, you
spoke about the certain

c64003cc-c033-44f7-8b54-9ae614ae4071-1
01:28:44.378 --> 01:28:47.176
guidelines coming for
organizations. Will this be

c64003cc-c033-44f7-8b54-9ae614ae4071-2
01:28:47.176 --> 01:28:50.702
subject to a minimum number that
the organization organization

c64003cc-c033-44f7-8b54-9ae614ae4071-3
01:28:50.702 --> 01:28:54.116
should be of particular size or
will it be a blanket for all

c64003cc-c033-44f7-8b54-9ae614ae4071-4
01:28:54.116 --> 01:28:54.900
organizations?

690d1ab2-fb07-44c4-8117-5661338f2f5f-0
01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:00.728
That's a that's a perennial
problem. No, no, I mean see

690d1ab2-fb07-44c4-8117-5661338f2f5f-1
01:29:00.728 --> 01:29:02.360
something which is like.

1be95e05-a522-4c83-9f35-53984c79a456-0
01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:06.790
What certain issue last year was
a direction?

b6c14881-7162-4001-9152-905b6dd8a7a7-0
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:11.525
And direction means it's it was
applicable to almost every

b6c14881-7162-4001-9152-905b6dd8a7a7-1
01:29:11.525 --> 01:29:14.918
organization the respective of
the size. And by the way, in

b6c14881-7162-4001-9152-905b6dd8a7a7-2
01:29:14.918 --> 01:29:17.010
cyber security size does not
matter.

df443611-2ce6-4ce9-9dc1-574f9079ffa6-0
01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.149
Even a small IoT and a
vulnerability in a small IoT can

df443611-2ce6-4ce9-9dc1-574f9079ffa6-1
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:29.628
impact and a very, I should say
low cost product can lead to

df443611-2ce6-4ce9-9dc1-574f9079ffa6-2
01:29:29.628 --> 01:29:33.670
whatever level of disaster you
can think of.

568c38bc-b89d-4980-9078-ca0db8754751-0
01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:39.615
So, so guidelines for that
reason or even if say I I need

568c38bc-b89d-4980-9078-ca0db8754751-1
01:29:39.615 --> 01:29:44.711
to talk via so 27,001 it all
depends upon the nature of the

568c38bc-b89d-4980-9078-ca0db8754751-2
01:29:44.711 --> 01:29:46.410
risks that you have.

3b7ac79a-64cc-4aa5-9219-687e71521940-0
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:51.980
Therefore, what is your past?
What is your likely future?

fac746d1-2367-490c-893a-f21cd5471ec7-0
01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.130
In which environment are you
working?

4d5f0421-c042-4007-8213-ad3a161726fa-0
01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.970
How critical is the business?

b019dde5-7b35-428d-baab-ac76dede9b6e-0
01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.100
And to that an extent.

6993c556-d41e-4348-98df-228e2b7a75e0-0
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:04.958
There is no prescriptive, I
should say, language of what

6993c556-d41e-4348-98df-228e2b7a75e0-1
01:30:04.958 --> 01:30:09.785
controls need to be in place. It
is for the organizations to take

6993c556-d41e-4348-98df-228e2b7a75e0-2
01:30:09.785 --> 01:30:11.979
call of how much is necessary.

fbe17416-ab55-4513-ba88-4ddf13296b99-0
01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:16.099
In respect of that particular
organization and that particular

fbe17416-ab55-4513-ba88-4ddf13296b99-1
01:30:16.099 --> 01:30:16.610
ecosystem.

91e5b640-8f93-4354-9124-7e3c56b726d9-0
01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.465
I think more than employees, the
amount of data that anyone is

91e5b640-8f93-4354-9124-7e3c56b726d9-1
01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:24.400
managing that.

42291166-3c07-42e5-9ee4-792d4a1da574-0
01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:28.740
Could give us a hint of risk.
For example, when WhatsApp was

42291166-3c07-42e5-9ee4-792d4a1da574-1
01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:31.511
acquired, they had only 50
employees, but they were

42291166-3c07-42e5-9ee4-792d4a1da574-2
01:30:31.511 --> 01:30:32.950
managing 450 million users.

9650a2b7-6ace-4de6-a1f5-763aa5cb7c3a-0
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:34.130
So.

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-0
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:38.417
Just having employees count will
not help anyways, completely

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-1
01:30:38.417 --> 01:30:41.714
agreeing. So, so nowadays all
these startups, they have few

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-2
01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:44.791
guys, but they are actually
managing data of completely

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-3
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:47.924
aliens and millions of people.
Employees therefore means

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-4
01:30:47.924 --> 01:30:51.166
internal risks, yeah, but at the
end of the day, number of

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-5
01:30:51.166 --> 01:30:54.353
customers means businesses
exactly that kind of risk that

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-6
01:30:54.353 --> 01:30:57.596
you potentially can help. But
it's I think what Ganesh can

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-7
01:30:57.596 --> 01:31:01.003
Pankaj were trying to bring out
is that smaller organizations

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-8
01:31:01.003 --> 01:31:04.190
should be able to afford the
kind of security that we are

5057d564-0d51-4e45-b793-6a03fe80a632-9
01:31:04.190 --> 01:31:04.960
talking about.

01e3c998-b232-4e1e-b384-bea22478789e-0
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:10.039
Uh and uh, I'm just trying to
understand how will we be able

01e3c998-b232-4e1e-b384-bea22478789e-1
01:31:10.039 --> 01:31:10.270
to.

bb769c21-aed7-4a7b-a86d-029e3eba9f75-0
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:15.804
Enable smaller organizations to
have the funds, which to them

bb769c21-aed7-4a7b-a86d-029e3eba9f75-1
01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:20.288
may not appear to be very good
ROI on the face of it, but

bb769c21-aed7-4a7b-a86d-029e3eba9f75-2
01:31:20.288 --> 01:31:25.005
actually when when it comes to
reality, it isn't. There is a

bb769c21-aed7-4a7b-a86d-029e3eba9f75-3
01:31:25.005 --> 01:31:26.320
hidden ROI in it.

bd6cb240-8f62-49fb-8831-a69951766fc6-0
01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:31.035
Uh, but a smaller organization
doesn't see it so, at least in

bd6cb240-8f62-49fb-8831-a69951766fc6-1
01:31:31.035 --> 01:31:34.366
the initial stages. So
vulnerabilities are inherent in

bd6cb240-8f62-49fb-8831-a69951766fc6-2
01:31:34.366 --> 01:31:38.181
smaller organizations. And how
is it that they can be enabled,

bd6cb240-8f62-49fb-8831-a69951766fc6-3
01:31:38.181 --> 01:31:40.120
at times forced and yet enabled?

5765a2c4-8e70-4648-bfa2-76ae99c15c5b-0
01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:43.890
Like.

2e41c62d-8776-4832-a180-6cff83ce9cbc-0
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.800
Which are foundation should be
able to help.

cf90ba97-74ab-4b27-a1a2-10d169d2714d-0
01:31:51.900 --> 01:31:53.730
Unfortunately there is no
shortcut.

29efae1d-cbb2-4fe7-bb0e-3a5bec78ea3d-0
01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:58.115
Unfortunately there is no
shortcut and business being a

29efae1d-cbb2-4fe7-bb0e-3a5bec78ea3d-1
01:31:58.115 --> 01:32:01.660
small does not mean that the the
issues may be small.

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-0
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:06.779
I completely agree. I mean where
the focus should be and how much

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-1
01:32:06.779 --> 01:32:10.487
should be the focus, that
depends upon what kind of risks

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-2
01:32:10.487 --> 01:32:14.386
are you willing to take it up.
So. So once again, I mean say

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-3
01:32:14.386 --> 01:32:18.286
for example, certain has come
out with these directions, but

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-4
01:32:18.286 --> 01:32:21.802
how many of them have really
implemented in letter and

58a94c01-31dd-4497-b31e-baa2f3cfbe8a-5
01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:22.250
spirit?

a8e3773e-7747-4916-afd8-5c81497278a2-0
01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:30.518
It is more of, I should say, a
business, uh, finally a business

a8e3773e-7747-4916-afd8-5c81497278a2-1
01:32:30.518 --> 01:32:30.890
call.

ac75c16c-2f13-4533-acf0-c3e2fba000fd-0
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:32.700
At the end of the day.

47de7c21-3b70-4595-9b11-e506f837d9dd-0
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.875
Good regulation, bad regulation.
But once again matters is an

47de7c21-3b70-4595-9b11-e506f837d9dd-1
01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:41.772
enforcement and enforcement is
something which I do believe. I

47de7c21-3b70-4595-9b11-e506f837d9dd-2
01:32:41.772 --> 01:32:43.690
mean an organization like Cert.

5113c58a-1ef7-4721-a92a-f6e767210be8-0
01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:49.382
Particularly chasing people to
or or maybe seeing proactive

5113c58a-1ef7-4721-a92a-f6e767210be8-1
01:32:49.382 --> 01:32:52.860
implementation will always be a
tough task.

44f91630-f979-4aaa-99d0-ce94bbd3f689-0
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:56.250
But the fact remains.

575c9aaf-914d-4892-882d-8f8bfb071077-0
01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.060
That once these directions have
been issued.

fd9ef69c-c0d8-44e5-b0fb-7e998b65eb2f-0
01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.150
Once the intent has been
conveyed.

ddddc155-688a-47b9-b802-b4460fcb2af1-0
01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.803
It is very clear that the
business of cyber security or or

ddddc155-688a-47b9-b802-b4460fcb2af1-1
01:33:07.803 --> 01:33:11.590
whichever business you are in,
cyber security has to be taken

ddddc155-688a-47b9-b802-b4460fcb2af1-2
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:15.561
seriously. Now. How serious you
are able to take, understand and

ddddc155-688a-47b9-b802-b4460fcb2af1-3
01:33:15.561 --> 01:33:17.760
implement this is a matter of
time.

b29ce156-5120-4940-99b9-6bde6a0d6fa3-0
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:25.256
Thank you, uh want to bring in
Salil Mithil uh Saul had cyber

b29ce156-5120-4940-99b9-6bde6a0d6fa3-1
01:33:25.256 --> 01:33:29.408
security for Reliance Jio
Infocom welcome cell. So until

b29ce156-5120-4940-99b9-6bde6a0d6fa3-2
01:33:29.408 --> 01:33:31.740
you have been managing you know.

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-0
01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:36.917
Multiple cybersecurity
compliances and audits for

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-1
01:33:36.917 --> 01:33:42.134
Reliance Geo. And you know Geo
is obviously national critical

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-2
01:33:42.134 --> 01:33:47.519
information infrastructure, you
know, regulated organization as

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-3
01:33:47.519 --> 01:33:52.567
a CI. So what really changes
once an organization becomes a

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-4
01:33:52.567 --> 01:33:57.784
CII? Do you have more audits or
is it more of checklist based

f3faf887-c0ea-4d9e-a387-d091d5c79e2e-5
01:33:57.784 --> 01:34:02.160
audits or you need to build out
proactive controls?

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-0
01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:06.550
For safeguarding against cyber
attacks and what is the

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-1
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:11.160
effectiveness of such audits, do
the radio help you again, cyber

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-2
01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.486
attacks? Because I think the
complexity of Geo is they would

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-3
01:34:15.486 --> 01:34:19.671
face the most complex cyber
attacks given the mix of data,

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-4
01:34:19.671 --> 01:34:24.210
telecom services which they have
and the plethora of apps which

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-5
01:34:24.210 --> 01:34:28.749
are being provided through the
Geo marketplace. So over to you.

8d5ea294-93dc-4ef9-ba26-0aef06c0fdf7-6
01:34:28.749 --> 01:34:32.650
Thank you. Thanks Ganesh for
inviting me first of all.

55d6c5e1-abc5-4ed2-9912-6a1977398fa3-0
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:37.370
So what's our was saying, I
completely agree that the size

55d6c5e1-abc5-4ed2-9912-6a1977398fa3-1
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:41.580
doesn't matter and this
cyberspace and especially you

55d6c5e1-abc5-4ed2-9912-6a1977398fa3-2
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:46.102
know when when you are dealing
sensitive information like

55d6c5e1-abc5-4ed2-9912-6a1977398fa3-3
01:34:46.102 --> 01:34:48.519
health et cetera, which is SPI.

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-0
01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:54.403
Coming to the CIA, uh, you know,
part, you know, it's a very

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-1
01:34:54.403 --> 01:34:59.265
interesting journey that we took
almost like uh four years back

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-2
01:34:59.265 --> 01:35:04.051
when the discussion started. And
you know, I think industry at

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-3
01:35:04.051 --> 01:35:08.609
large all all welcomed the
concept of CII almost five years

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-4
01:35:08.609 --> 01:35:13.015
back when we started with
identification of CIIS and what

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-5
01:35:13.015 --> 01:35:17.801
will be the what, what can be
defined as PII. But that journey

9459f816-01b0-4977-82d6-1dd9616f3076-6
01:35:17.801 --> 01:35:20.080
itself was pretty interesting.

895df1c1-8a5e-4758-a9b5-af2e5ab04ce5-0
01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:23.996
And now we have at least some
telecommunication, a clearly

895df1c1-8a5e-4758-a9b5-af2e5ab04ce5-1
01:35:23.996 --> 01:35:27.230
identified CI. You see what
happens is it brings.

1dc18914-8b2f-4c0f-9d2b-7256bc83cf5e-0
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:30.020
A certain amount of seriousness
within.

be5936f8-6aef-4a9e-8367-baa1d133027b-0
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.900
You know, because ultimately you
know that, um.

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-0
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.165
That that there is a system that
you are holding which is of

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-1
01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:42.073
national interest, right, that
that brings a lot of, you know

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-2
01:35:42.073 --> 01:35:45.856
of course focus and ensuring
security and controls. But you

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-3
01:35:45.856 --> 01:35:49.827
know, what I feel is more of a
difference. You know it more of

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-4
01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:53.609
you know because things are
already, you know, for example,

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-5
01:35:53.609 --> 01:35:57.202
tech oriented companies are
doing a lot of cybersecurity

ba72778e-b78e-4291-81fe-e436db3aa0f9-6
01:35:57.202 --> 01:36:00.670
investments and taking
initiatives, but it does bring.

972d809d-660a-491d-8f2a-7af730bd40e8-0
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:06.928
More focused from the leadership
and it certainly have a strong,

972d809d-660a-491d-8f2a-7af730bd40e8-1
01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:10.970
uh, you know, it acts like a
deterrence. So I feel that.

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-0
01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:17.748
Identifying scoping out CI is is
very very important and is the

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-1
01:36:17.748 --> 01:36:22.365
most critical time which we at
least as industry we took a

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-2
01:36:22.365 --> 01:36:27.061
couple of years all of us as a
you know and with the dot we

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-3
01:36:27.061 --> 01:36:31.599
took some time but it has its
own benefits and to to your

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-4
01:36:31.599 --> 01:36:36.451
question of audits you know let
me tell you cybersecurity has

c66fb374-3c2a-4b89-b136-119a72dd975e-5
01:36:36.451 --> 01:36:40.130
gone beyond audits now so you
know audits are.

5dfee222-7e53-4e06-928b-e5266c95f810-0
01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:45.443
Um, you know, nobody actually
cares about audit. We are

5dfee222-7e53-4e06-928b-e5266c95f810-1
01:36:45.443 --> 01:36:48.420
actually facing serious issues
and compliances.

b3a0b178-3fc9-4c06-b1be-2b126aa0f004-0
01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:52.751
You know, we don't need a
regulator or a external

b3a0b178-3fc9-4c06-b1be-2b126aa0f004-1
01:36:52.751 --> 01:36:55.929
instructor to come and tell us
that you do it. It's a

b3a0b178-3fc9-4c06-b1be-2b126aa0f004-2
01:36:55.929 --> 01:36:59.459
necessity. It's a necessity of
the time and the more we are

b3a0b178-3fc9-4c06-b1be-2b126aa0f004-3
01:36:59.459 --> 01:36:59.930
growing.

dc342095-0168-4c37-bc73-68754a261c39-0
01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.310
You know if you don't do it.

a0c97f7d-d5a5-4025-9773-cef077fbaa12-0
01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:07.718
We will not have, uh, you know,
things that we want to do. So

a0c97f7d-d5a5-4025-9773-cef077fbaa12-1
01:37:07.718 --> 01:37:10.020
it's like, you know, it's a
matter of.

e53622d4-6592-4e85-a005-234236e32f1b-0
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:15.501
I would say do or die kind of a
situation. So. So that's how I

e53622d4-6592-4e85-a005-234236e32f1b-1
01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:19.642
see and CI is something which
you know at least at my personal

e53622d4-6592-4e85-a005-234236e32f1b-2
01:37:19.642 --> 01:37:23.323
level I have pretty much
appreciated the journey and we

e53622d4-6592-4e85-a005-234236e32f1b-3
01:37:23.323 --> 01:37:27.399
are interacting closely with
with agencies and they certainly

e53622d4-6592-4e85-a005-234236e32f1b-4
01:37:27.399 --> 01:37:30.160
value it and it's a pretty
positive move.

71f761de-dafb-465b-abbc-9099cb96983d-0
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:35.160
Thank you, Sir, with respect to
you know.

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-0
01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:39.614
Lot of vendors and 3rd party
ecosystem providers, how does

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-1
01:37:39.614 --> 01:37:43.454
the journey change for them?
Because I think the main part is

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-2
01:37:43.454 --> 01:37:47.418
also the suppliers where most of
the risk originate from. Today

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-3
01:37:47.418 --> 01:37:51.197
we are third party 4th party
suppliers and I'll also add ask

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-4
01:37:51.197 --> 01:37:54.665
Doctor Debu to come in on this
because I think from the

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-5
01:37:54.665 --> 01:37:58.382
organization where he is or
where he was earlier, there was

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-6
01:37:58.382 --> 01:38:02.222
a lot of compliance which used
to come to them as part of NCI

cf14a34a-e062-4e86-9726-950739ec4f7a-7
01:38:02.222 --> 01:38:02.469
PCC.

8842092e-ae3e-4426-bd59-6269ef004462-0
01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:11.037
Sorry. So should I? Yeah, go
ahead, go ahead. OK. You see, it

8842092e-ae3e-4426-bd59-6269ef004462-1
01:38:11.037 --> 01:38:15.603
is the entire, you know, the
fraternity, or I would say the

8842092e-ae3e-4426-bd59-6269ef004462-2
01:38:15.603 --> 01:38:17.809
entire ecosystem is maturing.

7e4d43f2-5f7d-4a11-b003-c031e8de8589-0
01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:21.000
So with let's say.

53d8e4ca-1bfd-48d7-92d6-1fa4b0a2faad-0
01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.380
You know, we just talked spoke
about IT and when when Sir was

53d8e4ca-1bfd-48d7-92d6-1fa4b0a2faad-1
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:29.201
talking about you know, how to
device, I was thinking about the

53d8e4ca-1bfd-48d7-92d6-1fa4b0a2faad-2
01:38:29.201 --> 01:38:31.350
Mirai attack that happened in
2016.

b018d31b-7b6a-4137-a40f-3160524aa7c0-0
01:38:32.710 --> 01:38:37.778
In fact, that was a small core
written by uh, a student, right,

b018d31b-7b6a-4137-a40f-3160524aa7c0-1
01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:42.450
which brought down almost like
30% of the Internet by just

b018d31b-7b6a-4137-a40f-3160524aa7c0-2
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:47.597
impacting DNS. So. So that's the
power of IoT which impacted all

b018d31b-7b6a-4137-a40f-3160524aa7c0-3
01:38:47.597 --> 01:38:51.240
the, you know, routers, webcams,
etc etc. So.

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-0
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:57.089
So now with with learning was
humongous, you know what I can

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-1
01:38:57.089 --> 01:39:01.736
do because now we're not talking
about millions of devices but

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-2
01:39:01.736 --> 01:39:06.162
billions and trillions and the
number the, the explosion of

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-3
01:39:06.162 --> 01:39:10.810
devices is happening as we are
moving forward. So we have seen

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-4
01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:14.940
a lot of maturity and a lot of
you know secure security

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-5
01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.588
frameworks being designed for
irrated systems, right similarly

02588dbd-aed5-4e35-8b10-b948802eeb29-6
01:39:19.588 --> 01:39:22.760
you know the manufacturers, the
suppliers.

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-0
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:27.494
You know, they are also bringing
that seriousness. So there is

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-1
01:39:27.494 --> 01:39:31.661
certainly an uplift and at least
I can tell you from the

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-2
01:39:31.661 --> 01:39:36.046
regulatory perspective that now
there is a national trusted

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-3
01:39:36.046 --> 01:39:40.432
devices portal that is there now
vendors are being asked to

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-4
01:39:40.432 --> 01:39:44.598
register their devices and there
is an entire process of

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-5
01:39:44.598 --> 01:39:48.983
formulation of that trust. And
GSMA, there's another agency

909e7450-db96-4110-9e2e-c3f65b488a39-6
01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:53.149
that works closely with telecom
is coming up with those.

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-0
01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:57.672
You know for certifications and
exist. So I would say that the

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-1
01:39:57.672 --> 01:40:01.700
the entire ecosystem is, is
improving and there is a you

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-2
01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:06.152
know and and that that is the
need of the hour. So I would say

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-3
01:40:06.152 --> 01:40:10.462
that we are certainly moving,
but is the speed right, maybe,

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-4
01:40:10.462 --> 01:40:14.632
maybe not. Do we need to do
more? Certainly yes. So that's

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-5
01:40:14.632 --> 01:40:19.013
how it is. But things are facing
up, it's moving in the right

06ef9b00-5c99-4345-9a09-1b9d34246e96-6
01:40:19.013 --> 01:40:19.720
direction.

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-0
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.940
Thank you, Doctor Devi. Yeah,
just correlating what actually

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-1
01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:28.667
we are doing in telecom space
since I came from telecom

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-2
01:40:28.667 --> 01:40:32.594
background. So basically what
when we do the SLA agreement

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-3
01:40:32.594 --> 01:40:36.655
with our third party vendors, we
do tell them to do the MBSS

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-4
01:40:36.655 --> 01:40:41.048
minimum security baseline checks
and do the minimum hygiene check

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-5
01:40:41.048 --> 01:40:45.374
which has been formulated by dot
see you will find out there are

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-6
01:40:45.374 --> 01:40:48.902
a lot of good regulations has
been formulated by our

c75e41b9-480d-475f-ad00-836efcde6550-7
01:40:48.902 --> 01:40:50.500
Government of India but.

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-0
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:54.456
To be very honest, they spoke
less, but they've done very

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-1
01:40:54.456 --> 01:40:58.322
great work. If you see in the
telecom sectors, they have been

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-2
01:40:58.322 --> 01:41:01.876
given a very good articulated
how the MBS has need to be

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-3
01:41:01.876 --> 01:41:05.742
implemented. When I say MBS has
what actually it contains, it

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-4
01:41:05.742 --> 01:41:09.483
contains basically the password
management and the password

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-5
01:41:09.483 --> 01:41:13.038
management is very, very
critical and also it represents

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-6
01:41:13.038 --> 01:41:16.904
what are the various kinds of
user access management policies

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-7
01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:20.707
that need to be implemented when
we lease out to a very huge

35babfc8-9dd8-41e0-a013-c57a5f274796-8
01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:21.829
amount of network.

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-0
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:25.710
Then you must kept the users.
Who are the users coming to the

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-1
01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:29.326
network, what time they are
logging into the network, what

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-2
01:41:29.326 --> 01:41:32.758
are the activities they're
doing, what are the commands

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-3
01:41:32.758 --> 01:41:36.129
they are firing and that
commands is doing in terms of

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-4
01:41:36.129 --> 01:41:40.113
whatever various kinds of work,
is it a legitimate users that is

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-5
01:41:40.113 --> 01:41:43.791
doing it. So in that context
also you will find out telecom

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-6
01:41:43.791 --> 01:41:47.591
networks rounds with a lot of
operating systems, it will runs

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-7
01:41:47.591 --> 01:41:51.452
with a lot of various kinds of
systems which are also inbuilt.

3f92ad12-adab-47eb-899c-b39a02f79335-8
01:41:51.452 --> 01:41:52.740
That means there are.

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-0
01:41:52.810 --> 01:41:56.368
Proprietary vendors, those have
inbuilt operating systems. So

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-1
01:41:56.368 --> 01:41:59.755
the patch management system
plays a very important role to

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-2
01:41:59.755 --> 01:42:03.486
do the patch management system.
You cannot do it by single going

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-3
01:42:03.486 --> 01:42:07.217
to each and every system and do
the patch management. So we have

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-4
01:42:07.217 --> 01:42:10.776
to implement the configuration
management system and automate

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-5
01:42:10.776 --> 01:42:14.335
it. The moment you will automate
the configuration management

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-6
01:42:14.335 --> 01:42:17.435
system, the patch will be
immediately pushed from the

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-7
01:42:17.435 --> 01:42:20.764
center central server to the
various nodes and it will be

069a3532-5bb9-484d-8d0d-c41d9b7eb1f8-8
01:42:20.764 --> 01:42:21.969
periodically updated.

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-0
01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:26.679
Similarly you will find out I'll
just your ad audit is a very,

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-1
01:42:26.679 --> 01:42:30.562
very essential part of any kind
of network because all these

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-2
01:42:30.562 --> 01:42:34.445
things will be drafted in the
SLA with our third party which

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-3
01:42:34.445 --> 01:42:38.264
are we are outsourcing to them.
But we have to check with a

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-4
01:42:38.264 --> 01:42:42.337
thorough audit. So moment if we
do not do audit then you cannot

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-5
01:42:42.337 --> 01:42:46.347
find out what are the things,
what are the SLA. They have been

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-6
01:42:46.347 --> 01:42:49.912
have agreement with us whether
they are following those

420f6cca-d03c-4bf4-bfb9-190c17cdffa7-7
01:42:49.912 --> 01:42:52.839
exercises, what extent they're
following the.

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-0
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.683
SLS. So that is why the very
essential part is to do the

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-1
01:42:56.683 --> 01:43:00.792
audit. So that's why I also give
a lead auditor course and there

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-2
01:43:00.792 --> 01:43:04.711
have been certified ISO lead
auditors which has been goes and

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-3
01:43:04.711 --> 01:43:08.630
deep into the systems process,
people, technology, what Sarah

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-4
01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:12.044
told. And then they will find
out whether it has been

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-5
01:43:12.044 --> 01:43:15.900
implemented in the system or
not. And then you will find out

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-6
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:19.251
what extent it has been
implemented, what extent the

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-7
01:43:19.251 --> 01:43:23.043
SLA, because in the telecom
network we have to keep the SLA

1fe02ece-baed-445b-8a0c-5a9d0682cf71-8
01:43:23.043 --> 01:43:23.360
99.9.

d1105049-6a9f-4edf-95ac-4a3fe930f828-0
01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:28.528
So that way actually we have to
go very thorough in detail to

d1105049-6a9f-4edf-95ac-4a3fe930f828-1
01:43:28.528 --> 01:43:32.904
understand how actually audit
plays a very important role in

d1105049-6a9f-4edf-95ac-4a3fe930f828-2
01:43:32.904 --> 01:43:33.550
this era.

fcb814cb-fb73-45e6-b601-6292fd47cc9b-0
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:36.020
Thank you.

01:43:37.230 --> 01:43:41.281
There's no way, sweetie. If we
have to build out minimum

2c209c7a-b14f-4e8d-bbdf-e3e6f68f63c2-1
01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:45.900
baseline security standards for
healthcare ecosystem healthcare,

2c209c7a-b14f-4e8d-bbdf-e3e6f68f63c2-2
01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.180
where do we start?

9634be6f-97b9-4b7a-90c9-d73ae2e273d8-0
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:50.170
Who would be the organization?

4dab8dcd-3ad7-4a4e-ad72-749237b4b5f9-0
01:43:50.850 --> 01:43:52.490
That would have the mandate.

7c566d9c-399b-48b2-a963-d430d93410a2-0
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.680


ef8b244d-6c07-4ce8-b72a-ca5c9fefd5cc-0
01:43:54.610 --> 01:43:57.520
And you have to ensure audit
happens or compliance happens.

f60b9a9d-a83a-4425-bfa6-a6b6e8b6df6f-0
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:03.670
See that irrespective of any
sector, including the health

f60b9a9d-a83a-4425-bfa6-a6b6e8b6df6f-1
01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:04.230
sector.

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:10.321
You know, the baseline standard
I always recommend is ISO 27,001

13180fbc-68f8-4f81-a27c-5b4d103eee39-1
01:44:10.321 --> 01:44:11.270
coupled with.

01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:17.900
The guidelines which is ISO 7
which is 27, ISO 27,002.

7947d187-f488-4fd8-a814-07856208167b-0
01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.660
They can always be looked into.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:26.307
We are not saying that going for
certification of ISO 27,001, but

71a3b05c-ac3d-40f9-a0e3-45c38102a93c-1
01:44:26.307 --> 01:44:30.750
definitely any industry for that
reason must have a look at.

00eab4fc-11de-47d6-99f4-93c0b1bc7366-0
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:33.070
This particular standard.

01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:36.120

Which for which guidance can
always be taken, maybe from the

25998d96-b955-4282-a402-30a12aa83efd-1
01:44:49.048 --> 01:44:52.990
bias the ISO standards, maybe
from the sectoral industry

25998d96-b955-4282-a402-30a12aa83efd-2
01:44:52.990 --> 01:44:55.480

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.640
Amit, you know you've been part
of a lot of such.

28741149-a73c-45d7-8bc5-9da0ff128f84-0
01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.540
Activities on compliances.

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-0
01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.749
When it comes to the actual
situation, which happens on

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-1
01:45:26.749 --> 01:45:30.862
ground, say the aims attack, you
know, we heard that aims already

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-2
01:45:30.862 --> 01:45:34.850
had some amount of assessments
and audits done. In fact, one of

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-3
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:38.839
the big fours was appointed as
their cybersecurity auditors and

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-4
01:45:38.839 --> 01:45:42.577
they did finish an assessment,
but there were still aspects

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-5
01:45:42.577 --> 01:45:46.316
which were left open. So where
do you think are some of the

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-6
01:45:46.316 --> 01:45:50.242
gaps that need to be addressed?
Is it on the audit side? Is it

9e52ef6f-8525-4e7c-96be-f08ccfdf8a41-7
01:45:50.242 --> 01:45:52.049
on the patch management side?

dfc2ba6e-0871-4ebb-b513-957baa66023f-0
01:45:53.210 --> 01:45:54.850
Is it more on the real time
monitoring?

878226de-7f63-412b-842a-64b395e321b6-0
01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:59.711
First of all, this is the big
learning from the aims attack

878226de-7f63-412b-842a-64b395e321b6-1
01:45:59.711 --> 01:46:02.600
that even if you are doing
regular audit, that doesn't

878226de-7f63-412b-842a-64b395e321b6-2
01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.279
assure you that you will not
have any such attack.

1e92f526-27a0-4068-a79e-ef0d6b0065d0-0
01:46:06.210 --> 01:46:09.850
So there were regular audits for
sure by one of the big fours.

2edabb2d-186e-4dd5-86b3-a6f05f0fe3f5-0
01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.130
We had that audit report.

8698133d-f8fd-44b3-8e83-51962495b2ff-0
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:14.090
There were some findings.

be8c6c23-b4e4-4139-a076-1b07f3de0d60-0
01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.913
Some of these findings were
fixed. Some of these findings

be8c6c23-b4e4-4139-a076-1b07f3de0d60-1
01:46:16.913 --> 01:46:17.460
were not fixed.

f8510d83-722b-4024-a54a-2531e96e0872-0
01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.266
So another learning is yes, we
do not take these audit reports

f8510d83-722b-4024-a54a-2531e96e0872-1
01:46:22.266 --> 01:46:23.570
seriously, we think.

db615072-9ab4-4a49-a4a8-2eb61b8d130e-0
01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.637
Even if you are OK with 50% of
findings to be fixed, it's OK

db615072-9ab4-4a49-a4a8-2eb61b8d130e-1
01:46:28.637 --> 01:46:32.724
even if there is one such
vulnerabilities left unpatched.

db615072-9ab4-4a49-a4a8-2eb61b8d130e-2
01:46:32.724 --> 01:46:33.640
I think that.

c0fa2663-fae0-4d02-aad3-511e9cd6decc-0
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:35.210
Could damage you.

be3e040c-f316-4e87-8c25-1ffd3f77b295-0
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:36.880
The way we have seen.

b11697c5-58be-4bae-80cf-f0fa2d6a8ce3-0
01:46:38.130 --> 01:46:41.078
So 41357, which was focused more
on e-mail server

b11697c5-58be-4bae-80cf-f0fa2d6a8ce3-1
01:46:41.078 --> 01:46:44.380
vulnerabilities, in this case I
think uh, leftover and.

2d0f7f1d-c47d-4c99-a1a4-f48f9be85a5b-0
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:47.940
That was their life for two
months.

ea51c786-1b99-470c-9f0d-caaa5d5e2a00-0
01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:53.050
In the system. So I think this
is another learning 3rd as you

ea51c786-1b99-470c-9f0d-caaa5d5e2a00-1
01:46:53.050 --> 01:46:54.290
have said rightly.

157a9618-719a-47e2-9adc-d09c3ffa3881-0
01:46:54.970 --> 01:46:55.560
Uh.

4ee8dc35-a98c-4e96-8408-f6f426c4d51e-0
01:46:56.710 --> 01:47:00.168
That this industry itself is not
matured for with the with the

4ee8dc35-a98c-4e96-8408-f6f426c4d51e-1
01:47:00.168 --> 01:47:03.461
mindset problem, they don't they
they think that healthcare

4ee8dc35-a98c-4e96-8408-f6f426c4d51e-2
01:47:03.461 --> 01:47:06.810
sectors will never be attacked
or if even if it is attacked.

144ff25e-68b0-489a-9c2a-06d750a8e760-0
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.850
Uh.

77b957b5-e98c-4eb8-8040-e4abe422466a-0
01:47:08.710 --> 01:47:09.240
What?

5c67fb20-7921-4c81-9ab8-18a2b7ba3df9-0
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:12.120
The attacker could gain out of
it.

e2c552c8-f5f0-4d9f-b604-d1ebe4fa1271-0
01:47:13.340 --> 01:47:16.396
So I think this mindset should
be changed. Now we see the value

e2c552c8-f5f0-4d9f-b604-d1ebe4fa1271-1
01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:19.261
of this data and this can be
used. So if I see that most of

e2c552c8-f5f0-4d9f-b604-d1ebe4fa1271-2
01:47:19.261 --> 01:47:22.269
these healthcare systems were
attacked even Biocon or whatever

e2c552c8-f5f0-4d9f-b604-d1ebe4fa1271-3
01:47:22.269 --> 01:47:22.890
we have seen.

505eaea2-e64b-4675-bc83-59642ec97503-0
01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:27.108
The criminal was interested to
challenge the confidentiality or

505eaea2-e64b-4675-bc83-59642ec97503-1
01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:27.780
availability.

16716108-3a0e-4d6f-9b39-93b589e45765-0
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.780
We have never observed any
integrity challenge yet.

a1c37cac-1409-4f04-a803-8c7c4bc69d46-0
01:47:32.610 --> 01:47:35.810
But that doesn't mean it has not
happened. Actually it has

a1c37cac-1409-4f04-a803-8c7c4bc69d46-1
01:47:35.810 --> 01:47:39.227
happened that is happening, but
we can't see the repercussions

a1c37cac-1409-4f04-a803-8c7c4bc69d46-2
01:47:39.227 --> 01:47:42.535
of that because it is a back
door. It is changing something.

a1c37cac-1409-4f04-a803-8c7c4bc69d46-3
01:47:42.535 --> 01:47:44.000
People are not aware of it.

a5097667-9598-4f3a-b6bf-ce3ba16ea7c7-0
01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.803
And by the time you realize that
this damage has happened, it is

a5097667-9598-4f3a-b6bf-ce3ba16ea7c7-1
01:47:47.803 --> 01:47:48.230
too late.

0e710e19-90bf-4a5b-9da6-047ce08b8b79-0
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:52.256
But if the system is down or if
the data is out, I think that is

0e710e19-90bf-4a5b-9da6-047ce08b8b79-1
01:47:52.256 --> 01:47:54.920
something which we clearly see
and we react to that.

5a9362c5-e78e-47da-b771-376d4a036fec-0
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:56.970
So this is another problem.

4032a14a-cabb-4a9d-afcd-45ef35644e97-0
01:47:57.750 --> 01:48:01.067
I'm sure that the criminals are
trying all of these three attack

4032a14a-cabb-4a9d-afcd-45ef35644e97-1
01:48:01.067 --> 01:48:03.721
vectors to challenge
confidentiality, integrity and

4032a14a-cabb-4a9d-afcd-45ef35644e97-2
01:48:03.721 --> 01:48:06.783
availability. And 3rd, as you
said, rightly said that third

4032a14a-cabb-4a9d-afcd-45ef35644e97-3
01:48:06.783 --> 01:48:07.090
party.

2a460543-d604-43cc-b7bc-4b9d99c65087-0
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:11.088
Associations those are there
with these health sectors

2a460543-d604-43cc-b7bc-4b9d99c65087-1
01:48:11.088 --> 01:48:14.271
including logistics, including
other manner this medicine

2a460543-d604-43cc-b7bc-4b9d99c65087-2
01:48:14.271 --> 01:48:17.453
supply companies and all. They
are also not secure so the

2a460543-d604-43cc-b7bc-4b9d99c65087-3
01:48:17.453 --> 01:48:19.209
thread could come from anywhere.

c9828951-2759-4566-85c2-a436544b049b-0
01:48:20.150 --> 01:48:24.096
We don't have a process in place
to put guidelines on 3rd party

c9828951-2759-4566-85c2-a436544b049b-1
01:48:24.096 --> 01:48:24.590
vendors.

6b398f63-3e49-4bfd-8808-717697f8bed1-0
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:29.013
And to assure them, even if we
hack a third party vendor who's

6b398f63-3e49-4bfd-8808-717697f8bed1-1
01:48:29.013 --> 01:48:30.690
been communicating on e-mail.

34726e8e-7326-40e9-9594-eeb9d4b236ee-0
01:48:31.730 --> 01:48:32.580
And.

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-0
01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:36.596
This third party vendor is not
having a secure e-mail server.

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-1
01:48:36.596 --> 01:48:39.631
You could send an e-mail from
his e-mail server to the aims

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-2
01:48:39.631 --> 01:48:42.768
e-mail. They would open it, they
will they will try to follow

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-3
01:48:42.768 --> 01:48:45.955
that if there is a bill attached
to it or there is any invoice

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-4
01:48:45.955 --> 01:48:48.889
attached to it. So this is
something which is which I see

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-5
01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.671
that the possibilities are
enormous. It's very easy to

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-6
01:48:51.671 --> 01:48:54.706
create such kind of challenges
for these systems because of

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-7
01:48:54.706 --> 01:48:57.387
this missing policies and
missing systems especially

ee5eccc7-22a5-4708-a212-5338aa1ec87e-8
01:48:57.387 --> 01:48:58.450
depending on so many.

a69c6715-9564-4207-a2be-c6a84d563b0c-0
01:48:59.210 --> 01:49:02.330
Vendors. Those are communicating
directly with their authorities.

4a1d9c11-a8bb-48e5-ac2b-04b94e205e81-0
01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:06.418
So there should be hierarchical
ways of communications

4a1d9c11-a8bb-48e5-ac2b-04b94e205e81-1
01:49:06.418 --> 01:49:09.944
segregation of data. As far as
said, we cannot treat all data

4a1d9c11-a8bb-48e5-ac2b-04b94e205e81-2
01:49:09.944 --> 01:49:10.400
equally.

7e50ea13-d57a-4af4-b57f-d8e8b13e822c-0
01:49:11.210 --> 01:49:14.535
The OPD data, the the, the, the,
the diagnostics data, the

7e50ea13-d57a-4af4-b57f-d8e8b13e822c-1
01:49:14.535 --> 01:49:17.635
vendors data and then finished
data and also there are

7e50ea13-d57a-4af4-b57f-d8e8b13e822c-2
01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:20.961
different healthcare system
itself is a big industry so it

7e50ea13-d57a-4af4-b57f-d8e8b13e822c-3
01:49:20.961 --> 01:49:23.159
has all, all all kind of
informations.

d0efa98a-0dad-496d-b61b-042dde4dd7b2-0
01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.032
And we should classify it first
and then depending on the risk

d0efa98a-0dad-496d-b61b-042dde4dd7b2-1
01:49:27.032 --> 01:49:29.550
associated to that data we
should apply the mechanisms.

b28aa1c9-2d1c-43eb-a3c2-b13156cb4a49-0
01:49:30.210 --> 01:49:33.255
I think that is missing right
now and that segregation is must

b28aa1c9-2d1c-43eb-a3c2-b13156cb4a49-1
01:49:33.255 --> 01:49:36.203
which Government of India in
their data privacy, but I think

b28aa1c9-2d1c-43eb-a3c2-b13156cb4a49-2
01:49:36.203 --> 01:49:37.460
they'll classify all this.

d5b6588a-1bd8-49cd-b6ba-f825f53a7c9e-0
01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:41.404
Thank you. To something which I
think few of my inputs. Sure.

d5b6588a-1bd8-49cd-b6ba-f825f53a7c9e-1
01:49:41.404 --> 01:49:44.037
Uh, teju, deep uh. I think you
come from the healthcare

d5b6588a-1bd8-49cd-b6ba-f825f53a7c9e-2
01:49:44.037 --> 01:49:47.093
industry. We want to get in your
points here. I think you wanted

d5b6588a-1bd8-49cd-b6ba-f825f53a7c9e-3
01:49:47.093 --> 01:49:50.007
to share your thoughts. Yeah,
thanks. You can unmute yourself

d5b6588a-1bd8-49cd-b6ba-f825f53a7c9e-4
01:49:50.007 --> 01:49:50.289
to HD.

61eca467-79f2-4078-a9cd-6b7719d3a68d-0
01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:55.170
We are. You're new to tasty.

ad9e8d21-8fb3-4060-bd59-034184ae6f21-0
01:49:57.530 --> 01:50:01.556
I so sorry. So my name is deep
and I'm working with Fortis and

ad9e8d21-8fb3-4060-bd59-034184ae6f21-1
01:50:01.556 --> 01:50:04.880
I've recently launched a new
unit in Greater Noida.

908a4b07-b103-4589-8ac3-cac256b22f23-0
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:10.568
And the assessment of aims cyber
attack comes very important and

908a4b07-b103-4589-8ac3-cac256b22f23-1
01:50:10.568 --> 01:50:15.327
close to us because we deal with
every day out. However, the one

908a4b07-b103-4589-8ac3-cac256b22f23-2
01:50:15.327 --> 01:50:19.499
critical aspect of learning was
in network segmentation.

d8d9e537-f684-40d5-a9b8-2cc7e79e87dd-0
01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:21.490
Which was not properly done.

abe9749f-dc73-4fb6-978a-fb82b0a5594f-0
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:26.312
Look at aims and it is not just
with aims, it's with everybody,

abe9749f-dc73-4fb6-978a-fb82b0a5594f-1
01:50:26.312 --> 01:50:30.155
but at the end, I mean we always
look at, you know, vendors, we

abe9749f-dc73-4fb6-978a-fb82b0a5594f-2
01:50:30.155 --> 01:50:33.997
always look at Slas, we always
look at the Sops, we always look

abe9749f-dc73-4fb6-978a-fb82b0a5594f-3
01:50:33.997 --> 01:50:37.479
at the audit, but we always
misses the social engineering

abe9749f-dc73-4fb6-978a-fb82b0a5594f-4
01:50:37.479 --> 01:50:37.780
part.

0880cf76-7780-4a5d-b3fc-2117f5544e87-0
01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:43.275
You know, somebody wanted to get
in and they got in irrespective

0880cf76-7780-4a5d-b3fc-2117f5544e87-1
01:50:43.275 --> 01:50:46.683
of all the, you know, firewalls
with all the technology in

0880cf76-7780-4a5d-b3fc-2117f5544e87-2
01:50:46.683 --> 01:50:49.630
place, but they still got in
even after the audit.

26555534-5428-4204-8b6e-f700c9b5e5f6-0
01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.060
So not only does the
technological.

6fd318d7-9bc2-40e1-8499-61b289fbb4e7-0
01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:55.870
Check.

311e0ba5-1a56-4e99-af19-e3db698d1fe9-0
01:50:56.750 --> 01:51:00.110
Takes any precedence, but also
the human check also takes equal

311e0ba5-1a56-4e99-af19-e3db698d1fe9-1
01:51:00.110 --> 01:51:03.419
precedence, and that is where we
always try to ensure that the

311e0ba5-1a56-4e99-af19-e3db698d1fe9-2
01:51:03.419 --> 01:51:06.150
social engineering component of
the human error is.

3f93bd77-faac-48e7-93e9-c671b1380008-0
01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:10.060
Not exploited. So that's my two
cents on this.

e974bf91-0b82-4a13-acff-d174debec66d-0
01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.668
Thank you, Tep Smita, you know
you've been hearing us, you

e974bf91-0b82-4a13-acff-d174debec66d-1
01:51:16.668 --> 01:51:20.090
know, recently. You know, you've
written a.

0c889d19-71bc-4577-8cc1-de380f6f4be3-0
01:51:20.850 --> 01:51:25.236
A book on IoT, right? And IoT
has huge ramification when it

0c889d19-71bc-4577-8cc1-de380f6f4be3-1
01:51:25.236 --> 01:51:29.038
comes to healthcare sector.
We've spoken on network

0c889d19-71bc-4577-8cc1-de380f6f4be3-2
01:51:29.038 --> 01:51:32.840
segmentations but when we are
working on connected.

a0f4d9ea-ca54-472a-8b90-afb095e724db-0
01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:37.252
Cyber and Physical Systems,
network segmentations, uh is

a0f4d9ea-ca54-472a-8b90-afb095e724db-1
01:51:37.252 --> 01:51:41.400
just one part. What? What are
some of the other best practices

a0f4d9ea-ca54-472a-8b90-afb095e724db-2
01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.980
you think are important?

ee544c92-4322-4171-82a1-d14fbbe41b2a-0
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:48.706
Hey, yeah. Thanks for having me
here. Uh, see, uh, one very

ee544c92-4322-4171-82a1-d14fbbe41b2a-1
01:51:48.706 --> 01:51:52.218
important aspect when we are
talking about, uh, national

ee544c92-4322-4171-82a1-d14fbbe41b2a-2
01:51:52.218 --> 01:51:55.791
critical infrastructure,
specifically when we are dealing

ee544c92-4322-4171-82a1-d14fbbe41b2a-3
01:51:55.791 --> 01:51:57.640
with such a sensitive content.

8cf8d5fe-9a68-4739-afb4-beb094f7ee92-0
01:51:59.710 --> 01:52:03.621
Doing all this integration of
those intelligence from the

8cf8d5fe-9a68-4739-afb4-beb094f7ee92-1
01:52:03.621 --> 01:52:05.780
devices. Hope I'm audible there.

5b6183e9-d52c-48a9-b454-3ba8af62f03f-0
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:08.950
Yes, yes, you are. Please go
ahead.

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-0
01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.500
So first, first and foremost is
like say collecting all those

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-1
01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.614
signals from various uh
components because we are

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-2
01:52:16.614 --> 01:52:20.474
talking about like say robots or
say we are talking about all

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-3
01:52:20.474 --> 01:52:24.460
those devices which are sending
signals or say Internet enabled

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-4
01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:28.196
devices which are like say
continuously having those feeds.

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-5
01:52:28.196 --> 01:52:32.243
It is very, very important that
when we are putting such systems

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-6
01:52:32.243 --> 01:52:35.855
in place, convergence is
obviously one good thing. But at

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-7
01:52:35.855 --> 01:52:39.591
the same time are we encrypting
the data when it is passing

86c54c01-d5a2-4367-b7e4-af300b4f3070-8
01:52:39.591 --> 01:52:40.089
through?

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-0
01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.707
Different places. So we were
talking about like say I was

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-1
01:52:43.707 --> 01:52:47.498
hearing this panel here and they
were also talking about this

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-2
01:52:47.498 --> 01:52:51.168
encryption. It is very very
important that not only storing

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-3
01:52:51.168 --> 01:52:54.531
this data, storing it safe but
at the same time are we

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-4
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:58.568
encrypting it with enough strain
so that the data even if it goes

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-5
01:52:58.568 --> 01:53:02.604
out or say it is being exchanged
for a legitimate purpose at both

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-6
01:53:02.604 --> 01:53:06.457
the places, so data at rest and
data in motion both the places

903990f3-29df-4ee6-8de1-4c939951e932-7
01:53:06.457 --> 01:53:07.129
it is safe.

fe62a6b7-375a-408b-9a7a-519192bc7bfc-0
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:12.354
And uh, when we are talking
about this critical

fe62a6b7-375a-408b-9a7a-519192bc7bfc-1
01:53:12.354 --> 01:53:17.475
infrastructure UH-11 more thing
which is generally means like

fe62a6b7-375a-408b-9a7a-519192bc7bfc-2
01:53:17.475 --> 01:53:22.761
say ignore when people say that
OK they are totally isolated it

fe62a6b7-375a-408b-9a7a-519192bc7bfc-3
01:53:22.761 --> 01:53:28.047
and OT they're isolated there is
firewall. And actually when we

fe62a6b7-375a-408b-9a7a-519192bc7bfc-4
01:53:28.047 --> 01:53:31.930
go and check the reality is
totally different.

ffef7ab3-dc5f-4a07-826e-bda2adcdd69f-0
01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:36.079
They are having that USB or say
pen drive which is being

ffef7ab3-dc5f-4a07-826e-bda2adcdd69f-1
01:53:36.079 --> 01:53:39.570
inserted in those critical
infrastructure or says servers

ffef7ab3-dc5f-4a07-826e-bda2adcdd69f-2
01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:43.481
or engineering workstations for
updates or sometime given access

ffef7ab3-dc5f-4a07-826e-bda2adcdd69f-3
01:53:43.481 --> 01:53:46.430
through Internet directly to
upgrade the system.

49fb48f5-b4b5-46d1-b26a-dfb1b4ac4d07-0
01:53:47.730 --> 01:53:51.118
So that that defeats the purpose
of creating those kind of

49fb48f5-b4b5-46d1-b26a-dfb1b4ac4d07-1
01:53:51.118 --> 01:53:54.678
network segmentation, right?
Because you're directly exposing

49fb48f5-b4b5-46d1-b26a-dfb1b4ac4d07-2
01:53:54.678 --> 01:53:57.378
those devices without
appropriate controls. So

49fb48f5-b4b5-46d1-b26a-dfb1b4ac4d07-3
01:53:57.378 --> 01:54:00.594
built-in control is another
thing which one should look

49fb48f5-b4b5-46d1-b26a-dfb1b4ac4d07-4
01:54:00.594 --> 01:54:01.800
very, very carefully.

8008f7d6-fc5f-4ae0-a973-9ebbdcd871e7-0
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:06.740
Because the way it used to be a
problem in it, now most of the

8008f7d6-fc5f-4ae0-a973-9ebbdcd871e7-1
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:10.280
people are saying that whether
it be it cloud or say be on

8008f7d6-fc5f-4ae0-a973-9ebbdcd871e7-2
01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:13.880
Prem, all the infrastructure
should have built in security.

8008f7d6-fc5f-4ae0-a973-9ebbdcd871e7-3
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.760
We are yet to see that maturity
in IoT systems.

eb25293f-5d02-4f1b-a889-ce2b3d92301d-0
01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:22.334
Back to you connect. Thank you,
smita. I think we're coming

eb25293f-5d02-4f1b-a889-ce2b3d92301d-1
01:54:22.334 --> 01:54:26.077
towards the end of the session,
so now would want to get in last

eb25293f-5d02-4f1b-a889-ce2b3d92301d-2
01:54:26.077 --> 01:54:27.920
closing thoughts from everybody.

c247eb69-49d9-4e78-b31d-a31d4d047bbc-0
01:54:29.530 --> 01:54:30.200
Maheshwari.

e880c4c0-c0bd-48b8-a46d-bcaecdf1e63b-0
01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:32.010
Uh.

e72133e7-d23b-495e-af27-8fcd65eeb416-0
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:36.871
I would just like to mention
that security is everybody's

e72133e7-d23b-495e-af27-8fcd65eeb416-1
01:54:36.871 --> 01:54:37.720
responsibility.

e2b2726d-1e62-446c-87fc-a8188fb5f52d-0
01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:44.380
The need for cyber security will
continue to evolve, and to that

e2b2726d-1e62-446c-87fc-a8188fb5f52d-1
01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:45.010
an extent.

35b244e9-f135-4ab4-abd9-cdfd224a6f08-0
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:50.427
Organization should continue to
invest not only in terms of

35b244e9-f135-4ab4-abd9-cdfd224a6f08-1
01:54:50.427 --> 01:54:53.310
technical controls, but also in
terms of.

c4ba9657-fe25-4883-ae47-5cbe475d2f1c-0
01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:55.840
Educating people.

0f954a21-ce68-4084-b6b9-442a0dc792d2-0
01:54:57.590 --> 01:55:01.235
Their own employees, and that's
a ongoing and a continuous

0f954a21-ce68-4084-b6b9-442a0dc792d2-1
01:55:01.235 --> 01:55:01.730
process.

89d212bb-5ff9-4b08-856e-c6c3bfd98f57-0
01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:04.150
Thank you.

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-0
01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:10.403
Michael and yeah, uh, I think
my, my thought on this is that,

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-1
01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:14.654
uh, we need to develop not only
systems, but we have to get

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-2
01:55:14.654 --> 01:55:18.551
self-reliant with the kind of
requirements or hardware

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-3
01:55:18.551 --> 01:55:23.086
requirements which are there. A
lot of work is already probably

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-4
01:55:23.086 --> 01:55:27.408
going into it. We hear a lot
about chips now hopefully going

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-5
01:55:27.408 --> 01:55:31.943
to get manufactured in India. We
need to have our own cloud. So

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-6
01:55:31.943 --> 01:55:35.840
we need to create our own
systems and we need to do it

a48741d7-1549-4fa3-b954-3c3a3e873d31-7
01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:36.620
super fast.

23dd0e41-2c6f-4fef-8766-17bf4b394a2b-0
01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.726
So the amount of priority that
needs to be put into this,

23dd0e41-2c6f-4fef-8766-17bf4b394a2b-1
01:55:39.726 --> 01:55:42.926
whether it's healthcare or other
sectors, I think it's a very,

23dd0e41-2c6f-4fef-8766-17bf4b394a2b-2
01:55:42.926 --> 01:55:44.450
very high priority sector now.

ae79a309-231f-4f04-9962-390f9dde4680-0
01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:46.610
Thank you, doctor Debu.

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-0
01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:51.577
So I will say, uh, like we have
a HIPAA regulation which is

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-1
01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:55.854
basically used for healthcare
systems. We need to have some

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-2
01:55:55.854 --> 01:56:00.131
kind of regulation in India
which will create that baseline

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-3
01:56:00.131 --> 01:56:04.409
and based on this we will find
out how it will be basically

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-4
01:56:04.409 --> 01:56:08.829
catered to those systems. And
since medical will be very much

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-5
01:56:08.829 --> 01:56:13.249
depends on the in future you
will be on robotic surgeries and

9df30387-884f-40ca-a3d1-50e33caa96e3-6
01:56:13.249 --> 01:56:17.170
to understand the robotic
surgeries if very prominent.

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-0
01:56:17.250 --> 01:56:21.164
Person needs are going under
surgery and then you will find

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-1
01:56:21.164 --> 01:56:24.818
out the operating algorithms or
artificial intelligence

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-2
01:56:24.818 --> 01:56:28.537
algorithms, machine learning
algorithms, if they are not

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-3
01:56:28.537 --> 01:56:31.995
behaving transparently,
ethically and then that will

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-4
01:56:31.995 --> 01:56:36.170
create havoc. So we must be very
sensitive. Even one human life

66cf2033-b42c-4ef8-9109-4f5de480add0-5
01:56:36.170 --> 01:56:40.020
cause will be an essence loss.
So because because of this.

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-0
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.605
Kind of thing. So that's why uh,
maybe you can segregate if we

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-1
01:56:45.605 --> 01:56:49.949
have the, we have a prominent
person going into that kind of

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-2
01:56:49.949 --> 01:56:54.292
thing. So that's why bringing a
HIPAA kind of regulation and

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-3
01:56:54.292 --> 01:56:58.778
embedding all these technologies
as technology. When you bring

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-4
01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:02.979
the regulation of course you
cannot point out a technology

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-5
01:57:02.979 --> 01:57:07.180
because technology agnostic
regulation you need to have to

bcb7a0bb-a8b6-4e38-98a1-44e5275e7a39-6
01:57:07.180 --> 01:57:11.310
be brought and based on this you
have to like the US, UK.

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-0
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:15.735
And the European Union they're
bringing and that way actually

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-1
01:57:15.735 --> 01:57:19.941
we have to see how actually we
can brought a regulation and

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-2
01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:23.586
that will cater to the next
generation and the next

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-3
01:57:23.586 --> 01:57:27.862
generation you will find out
will be helpful if we brought a

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-4
01:57:27.862 --> 01:57:32.489
specific medical kind of devices
regulated by a robust regulation

4875ace0-d1f3-4cff-b7b5-12e87794038c-5
01:57:32.489 --> 01:57:33.190
mechanism.

d99e30a6-40d1-454e-9834-844a73a53967-0
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:39.580
Thank you, smita. Your thoughts
in terms of what we can do more?

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-0
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:45.547
Sure, sure. So one thing is
very, uh, uh, good or say when

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-1
01:57:45.547 --> 01:57:49.448
we are sitting here together, it
is a private and public

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-2
01:57:49.448 --> 01:57:53.554
partnership where we say that,
OK, we know three things are

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-3
01:57:53.554 --> 01:57:57.660
needed, people, process and
technology, all three together.

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-4
01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:01.698
We have to bond to bring this
change which we are speaking

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-5
01:58:01.698 --> 01:58:05.393
about. All these things has to
be in place. The right

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-6
01:58:05.393 --> 01:58:09.636
technology, the right people and
the processes obviously will

19ef840b-9b39-4030-bb2a-d2eaf6c95771-7
01:58:09.636 --> 01:58:12.100
help us to navigate this
situation.

e127bc93-0e24-4031-8b9e-6e5069c1ff30-0
01:58:12.170 --> 01:58:16.551
Where we are today and it is
very, very important that we

e127bc93-0e24-4031-8b9e-6e5069c1ff30-1
01:58:16.551 --> 01:58:21.159
pull these things together and
and create such a bond or say

e127bc93-0e24-4031-8b9e-6e5069c1ff30-2
01:58:21.159 --> 01:58:26.070
that Community where we talk and
we we create that that connect.

56155271-ab17-4e5a-851e-c39b20fb36b6-0
01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:28.520
So back to your kanesh.

53e95a97-cb8c-4996-8a80-a58e40769820-0
01:58:29.480 --> 01:58:32.693
Thank you, Samuel. Thank you,
smita. This is very helpful.

53e95a97-cb8c-4996-8a80-a58e40769820-1
01:58:32.693 --> 01:58:33.020
Salil.

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-0
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:38.735
See, I was, uh, you know, I
remembered in 2017, I guess

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-1
01:58:38.735 --> 01:58:43.161
about company recalled almost
like 4,00,000 or five Lac

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-2
01:58:43.161 --> 01:58:47.745
pacemakers because they were
vulnerable to cyber patches,

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-3
01:58:47.745 --> 01:58:52.408
right. And in the vicinity
somebody can do some, you know,

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-4
01:58:52.408 --> 01:58:57.467
manipulation in terms of even a
skip of heartbeat was possible.

d47e71dc-cbd8-4210-82fb-cfbd2462dbd8-5
01:58:57.467 --> 01:58:59.679
It happened in 2017 I guess.

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-0
01:59:00.510 --> 01:59:04.492
What I foresee probably is being
a tech enthusiast that what

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-1
01:59:04.492 --> 01:59:08.475
Fintech has seen, what Edtech
has seen, what other you know,

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-2
01:59:08.475 --> 01:59:12.457
industry verticals are seeing as
a, as a, you know similarly

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-3
01:59:12.457 --> 01:59:16.179
health, health track is is
coming up right. We have such

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-4
01:59:16.179 --> 01:59:20.292
intelligent devices coming up
and this will with the amount of

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-5
01:59:20.292 --> 01:59:24.013
you know hail surveillance or
you know diseases that are

e9772bc8-9e67-4998-acb9-c97531951162-6
01:59:24.013 --> 01:59:26.560
coming up the health sector will
take.

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-0
01:59:27.330 --> 01:59:32.125
A major, you know in times to
come maybe in the near future.

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-1
01:59:32.125 --> 01:59:36.999
So you know because of IoT, 5G
etcetera, etcetera. So the the

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-2
01:59:36.999 --> 01:59:41.008
impact of this sector is
humongous and it adds the

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-3
01:59:41.008 --> 01:59:45.882
element of you know health and
safety into cyber. So just not

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-4
01:59:45.882 --> 01:59:50.835
confidentiality, integrity and
availability, but it's a matter

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-5
01:59:50.835 --> 01:59:55.316
of you know maybe life and
death. So that's serious this

741dc51c-6b11-431c-96f6-4d7705715a90-6
01:59:55.316 --> 01:59:57.360
industry would be and the.

7967c696-1622-4fb0-bde0-c7b67ee8a9a4-0
01:59:57.450 --> 02:00:00.350
The appliances and applications
so.

f57c5181-d804-494e-8aeb-397d16f4292e-0
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:04.936
We all have to bridge it up and
bring all our learnings,

f57c5181-d804-494e-8aeb-397d16f4292e-1
02:00:04.936 --> 02:00:08.732
capability building what our
speaker has said, you know that

f57c5181-d804-494e-8aeb-397d16f4292e-2
02:00:08.732 --> 02:00:12.403
we have to bring in House
capability and that's that's how

f57c5181-d804-494e-8aeb-397d16f4292e-3
02:00:12.403 --> 02:00:15.390
we'll be able to sail through
this, this thing.

02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:22.570
Thank you, Technip. Penny, you
know, closing remarks from you.

7cc77b7b-10a4-4418-9c4d-e2039b2db0e8-0
02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:25.820
Umm.

604b47b4-bc28-457b-bf49-ac4b3c683c10-0
02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:31.538
So I would just add on to what
Salil said that you know, what

604b47b4-bc28-457b-bf49-ac4b3c683c10-1
02:00:31.538 --> 02:00:35.353
we learned from the health,
Fintech and other technology

604b47b4-bc28-457b-bf49-ac4b3c683c10-2
02:00:35.353 --> 02:00:39.770
aspects, you know, harm in other
industries are more of monetary.

52789dc7-0f42-49c5-870e-ae17150a4267-0
02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:43.752
You know, but when it comes to
health tech, the harm is life

52789dc7-0f42-49c5-870e-ae17150a4267-1
02:00:43.752 --> 02:00:44.130
itself.

bcfa63c7-f227-498c-a742-9ca200475928-0
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:48.434
And, you know, we look at life
day in, day out and you know,

bcfa63c7-f227-498c-a742-9ca200475928-1
02:00:48.434 --> 02:00:51.861
the only happiness which a
hospital or a health environment

bcfa63c7-f227-498c-a742-9ca200475928-2
02:00:51.861 --> 02:00:55.574
provides is probably a birthing
experience. But apart from that,

bcfa63c7-f227-498c-a742-9ca200475928-3
02:00:55.574 --> 02:00:58.430
everything is about, you know,
loss for recovery.

6de5b7ab-c0d4-4a2b-a99c-5f33533c56e9-0
02:00:59.190 --> 02:01:02.557
So I think anybody is going to
work in the health tech or the

6de5b7ab-c0d4-4a2b-a99c-5f33533c56e9-1
02:01:02.557 --> 02:01:05.815
healthcare department in the
technology or the IT or I, you

6de5b7ab-c0d4-4a2b-a99c-5f33533c56e9-2
02:01:05.815 --> 02:01:09.236
know, information technology,
the last headache he wants is to

6de5b7ab-c0d4-4a2b-a99c-5f33533c56e9-3
02:01:09.236 --> 02:01:09.779
be blamed.

4e6aa9ca-f30d-4a25-a570-2904b2b254d3-0
02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:14.060
For the death of someone because
a virus got through.

22416142-9e11-4f35-8dbb-9e0f4e32a485-0
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.638
So I think seriousness at all
levels of policymaking should

22416142-9e11-4f35-8dbb-9e0f4e32a485-1
02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:19.210
address that.

ab9eb90b-c47f-4f30-a3e4-bf25d355f2af-0
02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:23.445
That you know, somebody can hack
into somebody near and dear ones

ab9eb90b-c47f-4f30-a3e4-bf25d355f2af-1
02:01:23.445 --> 02:01:23.980
pacemaker.

fc1eb87f-a5f4-4f45-b18b-c38bdc9e9b22-0
02:01:24.740 --> 02:01:28.861
And cause an undamaged causes
severe damage without the poor

fc1eb87f-a5f4-4f45-b18b-c38bdc9e9b22-1
02:01:28.861 --> 02:01:32.915
guy you know, not even knowing
it. Then being involved as a

fc1eb87f-a5f4-4f45-b18b-c38bdc9e9b22-2
02:01:32.915 --> 02:01:36.767
leverage for some great
policymaking because some hacker

fc1eb87f-a5f4-4f45-b18b-c38bdc9e9b22-3
02:01:36.767 --> 02:01:40.686
somewhere has a hold on your
father's or your brothers or

fc1eb87f-a5f4-4f45-b18b-c38bdc9e9b22-4
02:01:40.686 --> 02:01:41.970
your own pacemaker.

9ee5d8d2-ee5a-4b64-b5b5-cdd4a77c7743-0
02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:48.000
Absolutely. That's it. Thanks.
Thanks, Daisy. Amit.

392e31bc-3780-46b7-a2e5-837c03d8d864-0
02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:58.040
I have. I have a take on like we
all were.

029914da-5a20-417c-85a6-58d7992bf9f6-0
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:03.034
Concern for the situation when
these attacks will become so

029914da-5a20-417c-85a6-58d7992bf9f6-1
02:02:03.034 --> 02:02:06.281
sophisticated that they can take
some life. What if they are

029914da-5a20-417c-85a6-58d7992bf9f6-2
02:02:06.281 --> 02:02:07.079
already taking?

7f152978-48cc-4f01-ab95-8d908096cd3d-0
02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:09.220
Life and we don't know.

a5935f35-ae67-4a34-a0f0-34c4b235a5d8-0
02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.300
Did we do any such investigation
research. So that is my bigger

a5935f35-ae67-4a34-a0f0-34c4b235a5d8-1
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.514
concern that if it is already
happening and we are not

a5935f35-ae67-4a34-a0f0-34c4b235a5d8-2
02:02:17.514 --> 02:02:21.137
noticing it and there are people
that are taking advantage of

a5935f35-ae67-4a34-a0f0-34c4b235a5d8-3
02:02:21.137 --> 02:02:24.526
such ignorance because we are
not focusing. OK, every day

a5935f35-ae67-4a34-a0f0-34c4b235a5d8-4
02:02:24.526 --> 02:02:27.390
people are dying. So So what if
two more people?

87d4092b-671f-4109-ab32-ba244cc5c63f-0
02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:31.564
Are added in that list. So I
think this is something which we

87d4092b-671f-4109-ab32-ba244cc5c63f-1
02:02:31.564 --> 02:02:34.932
should take very very seriously
and it should not be just an

87d4092b-671f-4109-ab32-ba244cc5c63f-2
02:02:34.932 --> 02:02:38.412
assumption that it will happen.
I'm sure if it will happen, it

87d4092b-671f-4109-ab32-ba244cc5c63f-3
02:02:38.412 --> 02:02:39.130
is happening.

7ad75f69-aafb-40a8-b800-1852b5daa277-0
02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:42.570
It is happening in round the
corners second.

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-0
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:47.962
They're also taking quantum very
lightly. So we need to move from

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-1
02:02:47.962 --> 02:02:52.298
secure to quantum safe very
soon, very very fast. That is my

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-2
02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:56.635
another request to all these
sectors. And 3rd there are also

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-3
02:02:56.635 --> 02:03:01.114
non IT components, so we always
think that component those are

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-4
02:03:01.114 --> 02:03:05.308
connected to Internet. This
could only be the entry points

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-5
02:03:05.308 --> 02:03:09.929
to such attacks. No it is there
are RF attacks directly that can

60c304e5-882e-49fa-b4dd-88728124f29e-6
02:03:09.929 --> 02:03:13.200
happen through these devices and
if you just.

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-0
02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:16.968
Do a little research, you will
find there are cases registered

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-1
02:03:16.968 --> 02:03:20.345
reported worldwide where RF
attack happened and they they

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-2
02:03:20.345 --> 02:03:24.188
took life. So I think especially
for healthcare sector, we should

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-3
02:03:24.188 --> 02:03:28.032
also consider security for these
kind of attack vectors. So these

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-4
02:03:28.032 --> 02:03:31.467
are a few of my inputs for
today's as a conclusive remark.

7eec1d88-f451-4d85-92f5-ea870a978aaf-5
02:03:31.467 --> 02:03:32.050
Thank you.

With this, we come now towards
the, uh, you know, end of the

42c4387f-aae6-4950-9149-2316eb2f3949-1

02:04:19.644 --> 02:04:23.334
the steps that could be taken
into consideration and when CERT

c5639e2c-331f-4078-91af-bd53b58c3bb6-5
02:04:23.334 --> 02:04:26.848
is coming out. With this new
guidelines, what could be done

c5639e2c-331f-4078-91af-bd53b58c3bb6-6
02:04:26.848 --> 02:04:30.186
particularly to look at the
healthcare ecosystem attacks

c5639e2c-331f-4078-91af-bd53b58c3bb6-7
02:04:30.186 --> 02:04:33.700
