Hi, Terrence. Hi, smita.

Hi. Hi, Manny. Good afternoon.

Uh, we'll just wait for people to be seated and then we'll

start.

Chop chop.



Hi, Terrence. Can you hear me?

Yes, yes. Yeah. So I think we just we're waiting for some more

people to join in once they join in and then we can start.

Sure, sure. Whenever you can tell us and we can get started.

Yeah. So just relax. We'll just see more people. Uh, the case

stakeholders come in. Great. Thank you.



Poop.



Hi, spita. Are you able to hear us?

Yes.

Ohh, I think we can start. Uh.

Am I audible?

Yes.

So, uh, Pankaj, I request you to set the context of the

consultation because I feel we've already waited a long time

for people to join in. So as they keep joining in, we'll take

their views. So Pankaja, request you to please start the

consultation and set the context, OK?

I will get.

Sorry, we're just waiting for Rakesh Maheshwari. He's on his

way. He's the GC cyber law and then we are waiting for a couple

of more people to do this step in.

You can have a quick round of.

Introductions. Meanwhile, I think Doctor Debu is there in

the room. Uh, doctor Debbie?

Can you?

Amen.

OK.

So thanks for inviting us. So this is Doctor Dau. I works in

uh Erickson as a cyber security head.

So basically, uh. For this I worked previously with uh.

RBI, Reserve Bank of India, NNPC I developing the UPI payment

system for the security.

And I was, uh, working for Motorola.

For quite long time, around four years and uh in Washington DC in

one year, then in Hyderabad for three years developing the

various kinds of security for Wimax system. Then I was working

for Walaja, Chief Cybersecurity officer. There we are designing

the various kinds of security system for telecom equipments.

So when I say telecom equipments, we are designing for

enterprise as well as consumer as well as the.

Our networking side, so we take care of the regulatory aspect

and also we do take care of how the security aspect will be

taken care in terms of when various legislation comes in

telecom as well as from the national Cyber Security Council

secretariat and sought in and then I work for sometimes for

ABB.

For uh, defining the cyber security strategy.

And uh, finally, I'm working in uh Ericsson now, taking care of

end to end cybersecurity aspect of managed service, how the

cyber security aspect of various kinds of threat will be there,

how will take care of those threats? What if there will be

any?

Ransomware attack. How will take care of those things? We have a

uh program running called hackme. So before Hacker hacks

you, you hack yourself and know what are the things that you

need to do to protect yourself and your company. So these are

the couple of things that we are working on it over to our.

Thank you, Sir. In terms of some of the challenges, uh, which you

have seen because you had worked with NCI PC in the past, right

now?

Healthcare was not a critical infrastructure and now it's been

turned into a critical infrastructure. So what are some

of the changes that you will see primarily for the healthcare

sector, you know would would we expect some kind of new

regulation to come out or whatever. So this is a very, you

have very rightly told I was going through a report. In the

report I find out that if a healthcare system is getting

attacked then the percent will be deprived of its treatment.

For almost 19 days.

One or other form. So that is the kind of uh digitization is

happening and the kind of things that will impact and if you see

uh it has been increased for the last year by 74 percentage.

And currently what we are finding 14163 attacks are

happening per week which is getting a lot of momentum that

healthcare industry need to be taken care. When we say

healthcare industry basically we are following the standard

called published by HIPAA and those American standard is a

very good standard and we are following it and this is how

actually we have to.

Uh, customized in terms of Indian requirements and the

Indian requirements, you will find out we have uh recently we

have seen couple of attacks happening in the Indian

scenario. So in this context you will find out they're not

attacking with a very sophisticated.

Cyber attacks what they are doing, they are sending some

kind of missing meds.

And they're targeting some kind of weak links where actually if

they will click that links then the ransomware will just sit

down.

And it will not create any kind of its action. So that means

when the EXE file will be there, the EXE file will not get

executed immediately. So what is happening the EXE file will

throw another exe file.

The moment it will throw another EXE file and that will get

activated based on the attacker which has been programmed and

which has been taken the time. So in that. Many people will

lose that they are not able to track what is going. They will

say oh I have a downloaded a link which is a very good link

and nothing has happened. But that link creates a EXE file and

that EXE file will create another EXE file and that will

in the back end it will execute.

The moment it will be executed it will create a lot of hard

work regarding. You have rightly told we need to have new

legislation should be brought in terms of.

I mean in the medical sector, because uh, we are our, uh,

Digital Privacy Act is coming. So I hope I have not gone

through it. Maybe they have covered the healthcare aspect of

some extent.

But it is very essential to consider considering the UK

scenario. Considering the US scenario where actually a lot of

attacks has been happened, it is very much essential to find out

a new legislation and that new legislation should be up India

specific because why I say India specific, the reason being is

that.

We are not 100% digital. We are in the midst of going for

digitization. So that means when you transition there is a

probability of attack is very often will happen. So that way

it will be half summit.

Thank you. Thank you, Doctor Abu uh I'll uh let uh, Terence, uh

come in here. Terence is the head for cybersecurity business

and national security officer for Microsoft. Welcome Terrence

and thank you for finding time. You know, Microsoft has been

doing some significant amount of work securing the healthcare

sector and we did get a chance to some of the findings which

have been shared in the past. So you know, over to you tenants.

Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, Manish and again good evening to my

esteemed guest speakers and people who have joined both in

person and online, it's a privilege to spend and share my

thoughts as well as you know, your your thoughts and learn

together. As I share my point of view, I thought you know, to

also make sure that I can present it so that you can see

what I'm actually trying to articulate and share with you. I

don't have many slides, I just thought I'll use one or two to.

Navigate the conversation uh and and make sure that you know I

can be followed online. So when we were at Microsoft as you know

like the the Microsoft Digital crimes Unit, this is a division

that has been put in place predominantly to look at

cybersecurity you know and protect I would say for the

larger good and this is where a lot of threat analysis,

intelligence and threat sharing works across both public and

private sector space when you're looking at healthcare and the

trends that are happening in the healthcare.

Notice these six, uh that are actually quite evident in the

last few months and as as I've also mentioned right, phishing

is a growing challenge. I didn't bring up speak about fishing,

but definitely fishing is also growing challenge. We just call

out some of the key things that are you know that are I would

say targeting this industry. Ransomware definitely is the

number one issue that we are seeing here and and we all know

that we've heard about certain healthcare providers.

Who were locked out and were unable to provide patient care

and were held at ransom. Attackers are really looking at

ways to leverage this to their advantage and and put that you

know in fact they don't even hesitate putting patients lives

at risk and that's a serious and so on. The second thing that we

are also seeing is the connected medical devices and the

vulnerabilities that they bring in. That's another thing that we

you know we are seeing which needs to be also put into place

when we're thinking about cyber security.

And and what all should the scope of a cyber security

framework look like in that of course data breaches around the

rise. We know patient data, PII data is something that is of

interest to the underground criminals and they are looking

at ways to monetize that. So this industry is continues to

see that threat and we also see some rise of the insider threat

where either accidentally or intentionally internal employees

sometimes go rogue and and lead to data compromise and.

Cyber compromises. The other thing that we also are seeing is

yes, we speak about BYOD, we speak about mobile device

security, but specifically in this sector in a mobile device

security, something that still has some work to do. We still

see health data, patient data access being given to the the

the entire Community or the supply chain that forms a part

of the health sector. And many a times you may not have full

control on the supply chain.

All the third party providers that are part of the healthcare

network, especially third party contractors or outsourced

organizations. So I think when we're looking at security.

And when we're, you know, kind of debating on what, what should

be the way forward. I think these are also some of the

points I thought I'll lay on the table for us to deliberate and

and think about as we look at, you know, what should the future

look like when it comes to security in the healthcare

space.

Back to you. Thank you.

Thanks uh Terrence.

Garima Smita, you have got any anything that you want to add?

Hi, Ganesh. No, I think since I'm representing Microsoft,

Terrance already spoke. So I'll come in later if I have an

incremental. Thanks. So I'll, I'll thanks. I'll bring in Amit

Dubey, he's a well renowned cyber security expert and he saw

a lot of cyber crime which impacts healthcare as well as

other critical infrastructure. You know he's solved multiple.

Crime investigations, which include ransomware attacks and

his work closely with NCIC earlier. Yeah, Amit, over to

you. Thanks. Thank you, ganish.

And I think this is the most sensitive area for cyber

security, a part of the defense I think Healthcare is uh.

Uh, the mostly targeted sector uh that we have seen in last one

year, we have uh also lost lots of revenue trust across

healthcare sector and such kind of initiations to include it in

critical infrastructure or to.

Create a spatial framework for healthcare. Security framework

for Healthcare is the need of the hour.

I was partially part of the AMS investigation. I was part of

many other such recent attacks investigation. So I I have my

own learning that how all these attacks originated and from

where they were originated and we could attribute it to to a

great extent to the state sponsored bodies.

And that shows that uh, the there is no dearth of uh sort of

a tools and technologies available with these actors.

And that's why a sector which is so vulnerable otherwise.

In Ames case, basically we have seen that it was uh, it was

following the regular audit processes.

Uh, they had a right audit just three months back. They had a

report and despite of that, it has happened.

And you identified few vulnerabilities though in the

system, but there were multiple factors, so we cannot.

We cannot make any one such factor responsible for this

entire attack because there were multiple things and that that

shows that that itself say that.

Whoever was actually planning this, they they they were

actually trying it through multiple channels.

They faced a similar attacks few months back. They lost some

data. At that time they didn't realize, but then eventually the

current somewhere was successful.

And the 41357 vulnerabilities of e-mail or any other such

vulnerability which was exploited. This was not fixed in

time.

So if I could extend beyond what?

We have just heard from the expert.

Regular patching is definitely a big big issue which I have

observed in most of these cases. Uh, the softwares are not

updated, especially the emails servers and the VPNs. And the

other thing is we need a continuous auditing process

instead of.

By.

But you're like having uh monthly or or or quarterly or

even having two audits in a year will not be sufficient

especially for healthcare sector because it is a very dynamic and

new kind of devices keeps on adding.

I also suggest one, if possible, to generate a framework which

could be blockchain based configuration management.

Why it is so? Because we have seen people are changing

configurations of many of these servers frequently.

And if we could restrict that.

Or we could uh.

Create a system back end system which could.

Be self learning that OK, this system cannot be manipulated.

This configuration cannot be changed because of a back end

blockchain which is managing all these things.

I think that will help and that is not only for healthcare

sector. This is this. This is applicable for any other sector

where we have not utilized yet the power of blockchain.

And this is something which later on when we do as a root

cause analysis, we realized there were multiple people those

were changing these configurations. They were

playing with those configurations because of many

reasons, because they receive a request.

This would have come through and spoof e-mail or this would have

come from an authentic e-mail, doesn't matter but any such

firewall disabling or making it lenient.

Can result to any such attempt. Uh, attack uh very soon, so it

happens.

You said rightly Sir that ransomware is #1, but ransomware

is also becoming sophisticated now. So whatever technologies

that we had to stop ransomware now it is not working. And

that's why I think we need much more sophisticated backup data

plans. I was not bothered because of this attack happened

on healthcare. I was much more bothered because we could not

recover from it soon. So incident response was not

proper.

See, we cannot guarantee that the attacks will not happen or

or we can stop any such attack instantly. No, it it won't this,

this kind of expectation is, I think, not normal. We can

recover quickly. We should have a provision, we should have a

proper IR mechanism in place so that just like NHS, when they

had one 1A cry and they could recover soon, within two to

three days, I think aims took close to 12 to 13 days, which

was too much for an healthcare sector.

So we should have a provision, proper provision for IR where we

could recover within an hour or two hours or three hours at Max.

I think that is something which we should plan and if we could

achieve that sort of SLA.

That will itself. Uh Harris, the attackers.

So I think that is something which which will go against them

right now they are confident that they can actually put this

damage for a longer duration and can actually.

Result into a bigger losses in many many ways, revenue wise or

reputation wise or maybe data wise itself. So I think these

are the things which which I see and I'm I'm strongly

recommending it to become a part of the critical infrastructure

body of India and there are.

Few other processes that should be required because most of

these healthcare sensors and devices.

They are being imported through various countries.

They followed different protocols and security is the

last priority for most of them. I'm referring mostly the

diagnostic devices. So I was doing an audit of one of such

hospital and realized that because of these multiple kind

of protocols they're not integrated in a smoother way. So

they are managing it through different independent servers

and that itself is a challenge that because if you are not.

Not actually following security processes for each and every

devices. Actually you are creating loopholes and any such

gap will result to damage the entire system.

So I think we need lots of effort to create.

Uh.

The standards for healthcare sectors for for, for protocols

and IoT sensors and and also servers especially because they

they, they they have to manage the real time data which is very

very sensitive and.

I think this other kind of provisions will not be

applicable here. So these are few my objective few of my

observations that I have seen in recent such attacks.

Yes, there were threats due to insiders. Also we received lots

of such complaints from many such companies to they do not

want to reveal about ransomware attacks. But but then we realize

that 50% of the time.

It is a job of insider as well. So ransomware as a service is

also coming in a big way uh, the Black Hat the the the the the

group from Russia they were offering it as a ransomware as a

service and we also learned that they were they were they were

they were offering a service and in in in revenue sharing model

7030 or 8020 like whatever we'll collect we'll pass it to you.

And so the way they want to reach out to these companies

through Insiders insider will make money. So I think this we

need to learn.

That we need to somehow create some processes to to check

integrity of people and to make them more responsible about it.

Right now I think these processes are missing.

Thank you.

So coming to a more basic question, what could be the

possible reasons why the healthcare sector is one of the

most targeted?

Who would like to answer? I yeah, please.



Uh, in telecom sector, basically I'm just giving analogy. If you

see in the telecom sector, they are basically going for a basic

hygiene test, what we call as a MBS configuration in the MBS,

minimum security baseline standard need to be configured

in all the equipments. And then we do a VPT to find out what are

the loopholes, how many ports are open, how many unnecessary

services are open, what are the various services are running,

what are the various kinds of services.

Catering to what extent to other it's a catering to governments

PDF services or it is catering to the public health. So we have

to consider all these factor into account. But when it comes

to medical devices, most of the medical devices are not scanned

or they're not be PT. They have been done on that devices and

these devices are #1. These devices are not down the

respective B scans.

That is number one. Second to is there is a security policy need

to be implemented and these security policy once you

implemented it has to be percolated to different levels

which has not been case in the medical segments. So basically

if we the security policy if we see the have been a very robust

security policy has been designed in other sectors as you

rightly told that now it has been the Healthcare is now

added.

And the CIP, previously it was not a critical infrastructure.

So the policy which has been drafted, if we see NCI PC's that

need to be customized for the healthcare system, it will take

time. In the I'm giving example of Indian scenario, it will take

the time to configure those kind of big hospital systems. It will

not percolate to the users immediately. And the third most

important thing is you have to create a user awareness program,

so in medical.

Basically what will happen there are so much of peoples are

engaged in their daily day-to-day life. So they cyber

security take us after thought rather than it is a bolt in

process what we called as a it is a built in process that means

cybersecurity. They will say OK, we'll see it in the letter, let

the other critical services is important for them. So that way

actually you have to understand since we are going a

digitization.

We are not or no more in the same mode as we are operated in

terms of like mechanical where actually you can take some time.

As Amija rightly told it will be 12 days to recover. Is it too

much? You should have a specific incident response plan how it

has been defined. It is normally defined in the security policy.

So that those kind of things at least need to be known by the

basically if you go to all the hospitals, I have been done a

little bit of survey after this incident this hospitals do not

have a seizure.

They have an IT officers.

Information technology officers which they look after all their

networks. So you need a dedicated sisso which will

understand the network, which will understand the

applications, which will understand where the servers

have been placed, which will understand what are the critical

presents data, where it is going and where it is being stored.

And you will also understand as Amidi rightly told, what are the

barriers, backup processes, how frequently you are taking

backup, your critical datas. So all this that need to be changed

then you will find out the medical system, the robustness

will come. That was the case in 2011, I will say in the telecom

sector also in India, when actually we started the telecom

security new regulation. So that's why I whatever connects

told you need a dedicated.

Security.

Regulation for telecom sectors, so that will actually.

One way or other way it will once it will comes from

government, it will force to implement by all the players.

Reason.

For me, asking that question was, does it mean that the

healthcare sector was like a sitting duck waiting to be

attacked considering the fact that in 2021 or 22 if I'm

correct?

It was the Indian healthcare system especially. It was one of

the most attacked in the world only after the US, especially

when it came to cyber attacks. So does it mean only it was

because of the lack of any laws, regulations for the sector? No,

not exactly.

The reason being is that Indian healthcare systems have been

targeted because of we have dedicatedly created a very good

vaccine.

Because of that, they want to understand not only the

medicals, also our where actually the vaccines has been

manufactured, how it has been manufactured, there have been a

lot of state actors are also behind it to know you mean the

COVID vaccines, yes.

So that that is 1 motivation for knowing what are the how.

Actually India is much ahead than others to know a lot of

things. So that is the one aspect. The other aspect I told

you 14163 attacks per week is happening to Indian medical

systems.

College 14163 in per week is happening to the Indian medical

system. It is not by me, it is given in the research.

The research finding explain, so if that is coming so basically

what happens?

Once this, that means, uh, they are also being blocked. It is

not that Indian medical system do not have a firewall, do not

have ideas or they do not have a CM tool. All these things are

there. But what amazed rightly told, it's a sophisticated

ransomware which has been coming.

I have not gone through uh AMS case, but I have gone through

the NHS case. What has happened when they they click that link?

That receptionist the link has downloaded the moment it has

been downloaded that EXE file. That EXE file does not created

any hub.

It throws another ex file to 10 persons.

And that created sending and disrupting the computers. So

this is how actually they have embedded or run somewheres are

coming in the near future. So which has been developing by the

dark web and you can go through it, you will find out lot of

ransomwares which have been dedicatedly for working for the

medical systems.

So recently also in Black Hat Conference, we'll find out there

are a lot of discussions happening in the medical systems

because they feel because of this pandemic this has been

sharp rise.

So what we saw had happened in the UK post NHS there were

advisories which were there. So for example if any healthcare

systems gets hacked then what needs to be done? What are the

resources that are available?

Right. What are some of the best practices that need to be

followed? Uh, post the incident. Uh, if you look at today, what

happened in?

Aims, uh, you know, what are some of the key learnings that

India could look ahead? We only can go to the websites of NCI,

PCC or CERT. So if we, India will have to develop advisories

or we'll have to build up a mechanism for incident response.

What are some of the aspects that need to be developed,

tenants want to?

Yeah, thanks, kanish. Can you hear me?

Yeah.

Yeah. No, I think this is very interesting uh, discussion over

the last 15 odd minutes slide. And the first thing uh, when

there was a question said why are we getting targeted so much

and and what are we missing and they will again promptly said we

do not have AC so in the healthcare industries yet. And

the practitioners who are actually looking after the

infrastructure are are more IT or software or application

oriented. I think there is a need one for a very clear

directive also.

Because sometimes it's, you know, there is something like is

nice to have and something that is must have. I think it's time

that cyber security regulation or or norm becomes more like a

must have for you know, for healthcare in India. That is one

that's my point of view, right. And whether that's, you know,

having a CSO and then there's various other form factors or

procedures like for example if we just look at our banking

sector, I mean that's a great example of the work that RBI has

done and the amount of.

Education and knowledge sharing and and and guided guidelines

that have been put in place that has really strengthened the

structure and of course we can do more there but I think you

know that's a that's a good mature sector to look at and

learn from and today Healthcare is becoming you know critical

sector for us and and that is where the future is in terms of

digitization and accessibility for, for, for even for beyond

the metros and as you go into the.

You know, the smaller cities and villages and all, so it's very

critical that we have the right framework in place. You know, we

put that and then that really builds the highways for creating

a digital healthcare infrastructure for the future.

You know, while you were involved in investigating the

aims attack, right? And there were multiple agencies, what

were some of the keys challenges? You think there were

more cooks in the room?

Were there access to resources? Was there information sharing?

What, what, what, what are some of the key learnings?

Unfortunately.

Yeah, sure. Please, please.

Sorry, was that question for me or was that for that for

somebody in the room? I couldn't. No, that was for Amit

since he was involved in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.

I was just, I thought it's funny and I was like, I was not part

of the investigation. So I'm sorry. I was part of the

investigation. That's why.

People, I'll give you a few informations that every such

agency, those were involved, they had a different mandate,

they were not doing the same thing. For example, if Delhi

Police was involved or CPI was involved and even later they

they look from an IT perspective as well. I 4C was involved. So

every agency has a different mandate. Some of them were

trying to find the root cause, some of them were trying to

attribute it to somewhere, some of them were trying to recover

the data or some of them were trying to see that if there is

any insider possibility.

So I think we need to understand that each of this mandate is

different and they require different sort of work.

If you say that, why could not they record because none of them

were actually trying to recover the data. They they had a

different mandate and they were working in that direction. So

that's why it took time and that their existing IT system or the

manager when we.

When they were discussing, and somehow I was asking, the basic

processes involved in their day-to-day operations.

And when I realized like they didn't have a backup process or

they were missing some of these regular check process, I became

little furious. And then I realized like the person who is

in front of me, he he mentioned that I'm a doctor.

So I was shocked that you had a doctor and I was thinking you

are an IT guy. So that's why I was expecting these things from

you. He said no, no, I'm a doctor, but I'm, I'm holding

this responsibility. So this was first such shocking moment for

me and I think this is happening with every such other hospital

that they they give this as an additional responsibility to a

doctor. They they, they don't have a dedicated person,

technical person who could actually answer these questions.

And we are taking it to like I think I agree with all other

such panelists that.

That they this is their uh site.

Responsibility, not a main responsibility. And this was my,

my, my, my, such first-hand experience.

And then I said, OK, if you are a doctor, then um, who is doing

what? Can you tell me the people, those are responsible

for that?

And then I realized that he is the only person who's doing many

things. So. So I think these are some of the revelations. And

then we had to start afresh, OK, let we'll go to the system,

we'll see that what all possibilities are there. We need

to create clones of the data and then distribute it across

multiple agencies so that they can start working from their

angles, capturing the log. So basic things were also missing.

They didn't have even. What do I say?

That if I will ask that OK, if there is a Wi-Fi system in

place, who is managing that Wi-Fi and what were the password

policies even this thing was not proper?

So they said, oh, there's a person who knows about it, we'll

get, we'll get it, we'll get it. So I said, oh, if he's the

person, if he's not available, and if he's on leave, then who

is responsible doesn't have answer. So I think we can

realize.

Poor situation of our IT networks and hospitals and this

is a learning.

And then I asked like why? Why is? Why is it so?

So they told me that we never thought that anybody would

attack hospitals.

This was their mindset problem as well. They said no, no, I

think why would anybody will attack hospital, what they'll

get out of it.

This is just some healthcare data, so I think the next

problem is that they don't understand the value of data.

And unless until you don't understand the value of your

asset, you will not put that focus to protect.

So this is something which we cannot just implant all of a

sudden through policies. It should come through some top

level mandate to be passed to them that, oh, this is required

because of the national interest and there are people that are.

Those are going to monitor it on a regular basis. So I think

these are the things which is missing right now and every

hospital and these are the government hospital and when I

see the private hospital as well, they are also going

through the similar kind of patch holes and loopholes. So I

have visited few private hospitals also because on breach

point we got some information, there is a website I'm just

missing which which publishes the data breaches.

And uh, we were just looking into those informations. We

found that in India before Ames there were close to thousand

such attacks. I think Sarah has mentioned rightly thousand 1463

something this number of attacks within two weeks or one week I

I'm sure.

And there were uh successful uh such attempts on few South

Indian hospitals and the data was there.

So I was asked to just look into those root causes as well, that

is it the similar kind of ransomware or is it different?

The attack vector or the source of attack? Whether it could be

attributed to the same people.

And we were doing that additional work as well along

with investigating the aims. So I think there were multiple

learnings. First of all, I'm not supposed to reveal a few of

these things over here, but these learnings can be used to

make our future better. And I'm sure these are, this is just the

beginning, this is just the beginning. The biggest bigger

damage could happen and we'll probably we should not see it in

future, but it could be life threatening as well that if

suppose some some operation is going on at that time.

The system is collapsed and they could not get the vital

parameters of a person. Uh, they cannot operate a person and that

is something which can also happen. Uh, I think we should.

Segregate. First of all, we should have a segregation

mechanism.

An attack which was which happened on e-mail server should

not percolate to the other databases which happened in this

case. So e-mail communication is a separate thing.

The Opd's management is separate thing the.

Diagnostic servers as separate things, so I think the

segregation should be proper and.

That is the first thing that we should recommend in every search

hospital second.

We should also consider uh recent news from China. Uh, they

they cracked RSA 204 bit through 114 qubit quantum computers.

And RSA 204 bit is the basic encryption backbone against most

of these uh database securities or credit, debit card securities

or even VPN securities. So if RSA 204 bit can be cracked

through 114 qubit quantum computer which is available

today, it is not something which we are expecting in future. I

think this is a big, this is, this is really a serious concern

and this will, this will threaten banking industries as

well and so all other critical infrastructures.

So I think we need to come up with more sophisticated quantum

safe algorithms, whether it is crystal kyber, crystal dilithium

or any other recommendation, and start working towards that

before it becomes too late, because this transition will

itself take a year almost. We have huge data, huge networks,

distributed and complex. So we need to think from now onwards

we need to become quantum safe.

We should change all these encryption mechanisms to

available quantum safe options. Thank you. Very interesting

point. And I want to bring in Doctor Debu because he's done a

lot of work, you know, on quantum, on encryption and he's

got a lot of expertise on China particularly. So Doctor Dibu,

over to you on some of these aspects.

OK. He doesn't want to talk about China. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Because the other main views are very personal, not related to my

company. So. So, yeah, what Kanishk told is very important.

Whenever you have any cryptographic methods, is there

any kind of system whether it is a the algorithms are used?

Basically they're cryptographically algorithms. As

Amija rightly point out, RSA works on factorial algorithm and

elliptic curve works on group mode arithmetic. So you need a

very stringent mathematics understanding when you build

these kind of algorithms. What are you finding? We need to

build the reverse analysis.

Abdul journalist algorithms building or writing an

encryption algorithm is very easy. Suppose I want to encrypt

some kind of data by using RSA 2048. It is very easy. I can

write an encryption algorithm by using RSA algorithm, by using

elliptic curve algorithm or by using quantum. But doing the

reverse engineering it will be very very difficult what we call

in terms of cryptography language.

We call it as a crypt analysis. So we need to develop that

factors in our country to understand what are the various.

If that capability we could have been there then the attack which

has been happened which has been encrypted the disk we could have

any immediately decrypted back. We did not have the capability

to decrypt back what are the datas are present. So that's why

my humble request is in the universities.

In the undergrad students in the PhD, we must create some kind

of.

People, those are crypto analytics and they can have the

real power who can do this analysis and they can decode

this kind of algorithms and they can really decode back what are

the original messages either suppose the messages or the

files have been stored in the database. Database encryption

and database decryption is a completely different processes.

If we even decrypt the database it does not give you the enough

information.

People do not decrypt back. What are the files stored in the

database?

Even if you go to the file level, if you do not have the

permission level in the files then also you do not have the

capability to do it.

So in fact when I was doing my PhD at IIT Bombay, I used to

crack a lot of algorithms. So I know how hard it is. You have to

spend a lot of nights and then you will understand the how the

algorithms work in step by step. Then you have to go in the

reverse way and you have to crack those algorithms. So

that's why I agree with karnish. Educational and awareness is

very important to build across our institutes.

And across our systems, so that we'll develop some kind of

crypto analytics and those analytics not only help to our

cyber force, they will also help to the nation building because

in the time of emergency as Amit Ji rightly told the operation is

going on. If the particular let's say heartbeat, the hacker

sitting at a distance remote place, he will change the

heartbeat or he will change the BP so.

You will find out there will be a lot of parameter variation

will happen the moment actually the robotic surgery will come.

And knowing the robotic surgery will come, who will do the

operations. It is AI based algorithms and these AI based

algorithms, as you are rightly told, there are many countries

which are not transparent.

How Can you believe that they are developing the algorithms

which will be transparent and ethical?

So that will also create a lot of problem in the medical

industry if they are not purchasing the right equipment

from the trusted sources.

So that way actually it will be very imperative to understand

how actually the cryptographic system works and how actually we

will find out to use those kind of systems in your system like

medical environment and then you will decrypt back the your

information when it is necessary.

Thank you, doctor Debu. So we've also been joined by Kapil Madan,

who is the chief Information Security officer for Max

Hospitals, Mr. Rakesh Maheshwari, who is the GC cyber

law for.

Government of India, Ministry of Electronics, Information

Technology and UH I welcome Major General Pavan Anand, who's

a distinguished fellow at United Services Institution of India

and director at Mudcat.

Anand, I would want to bring you in here. So far we haven't seen

that healthcare was considered important from a geopolitical

standpoint or in doctrines of warfare. Healthcare was never

considered as a sector which could be attacked, right? But

over a period of time, things have changed. Healthcare is now

becoming.

Important so when it look at National Safety, security or

geopolitics, what has really changed? Is it because of

COVID-19 pandemic or is it because of the after effects

that people have realized that this sector also needs to be

taken into consideration? Or is it just that we see the hackers

see more value in the data which they get from the healthcare

sector?

Thanks, ganishka. Can you hear me?

Uh, sorry, I came in a little late and uh got caught up with

something else, but uh.

My apologies to everyone here.

So although I've come in late and I seem to have missed out on

some of the uh, you know the introductory remarks which have

been very interesting and also from folks out, I think what I

can just throw some throw up more issues than I can give

answers actually because.

The way the Ukraine war and the COVID pandemic have.

Actually put us more into the digital domain than ever before.

We seem to be more enabled, but at the same time we are more

vulnerable.

So every sector which which is now using the digital medium and

every sector would be using the digital media more and more is

now going to get exposed more and more. So as we keep

developing into them, I think we need to keep looking at the

security aspects even more so perhaps at some stage.

As we enter it, the security aspect needs to be taken first

into consideration and therefore needs to be given its due

importance. Otherwise the system itself compromised at a critical

time means the system has no meaning. It loses its value

within seconds after an after an attack of this kind.

So.

Um, certainly. Uh, I can bring out that.

During the uh Ukraine war.

What we are quite certain about is that.

It was the Kinetic War was preceded by.

As a series of cyber attacks to bring down information

infrastructure off of the Ukrainians by the Russians, and

although the narrative is more from the US side, I dare say not

only was it protected more by the US, but also they were

offensive attacks by the US as well. Now, did that hit health

infrastructure? I'm not sure about that, but will it help?

Will it hit health infrastructure in the future?

I'm sure book.

So, um, maybe, as was brought out in the introductory remarks

by Kanishk himself, maybe we are heading towards health sector

becoming one of the critical information infrastructure

issues.

Now the the United States defense forces have also now

begun to look at the cloud as a vulnerability. Where the cloud

is a big enabler. They have started looking at their own

cloud as a vulnerability and are trying to bring in regulation.

Now if you're bringing in regulation to protect your

cloud, that is 1 aspect which which the GC would definitely be

able to throw light upon. But is that a physical way of

protecting yourself?

Maybe certain measures will have to be enforced by cloud managers

and uh by cloud holders to make sure that uh, the cloud is safe

for everyone. And this brings us to a very critical uh thing in

India.

Are we now looking at cloud to keep our data whether it is

health data which is getting more and more sensitive than it

was before or is it any other data?

And for that, should we base it on AI based cloud rather than

just a cloud and then start adding things to it?

My my take would be that we need to have a cloud architecture

which is more discrete.

I mean a segregated cloud which brings data together when

required and by only those people who have authorization to

bring it together. That itself will give you a lot of

protection for not only defense forces, but all the other uh

departments as well.

Um.

I I found that a little interesting where you both

remarked on, you know, somebody intervening at a critical stage

in a robotic surgery. Now that would be a really real time and

would need a very high degree of.

No penetration to be able to affect that.

But that could possibly come in in the future. And uh, it would

be useful only for.

Critical surgeries for critical people maybe where somebody

might like to interview. Absolutely. So they remain as an

app and you know you keep getting data and only at a

critical juncture. It's more like an assassination attempt I

would say you either kill a man by a bullet or you kill him

during his own surgery. So it's it's something like that.

Otherwise yes to create general havoc. I I agree that could that

could create a sense of you know disarray amongst the population.

And deny a lot of services to the population. So that sounds

in the future also something that will have to be protected

on a, on a, on a, you know, population on a complete

population basis, but not really. I don't see it coming up

very much. Now we have to start working towards it. No doubt. I

totally agree with you. So with these thoughts, I leave it back

to kanishk. Yeah, maybe I'll come in a little. Yeah.

Terrence, you know, make any point on cloud?

Are we looking for more hybrid cloud options? Uh, you know,

taking learnings from what happened in Ukraine, uh, right,

whether there were physical attacks on data centers and then

the entire system was shut down, so.

Do we require more systems than we saw companies like Palantir

actually use AI on top of the data clouds that were being set

up. Yeah. Thank you.

Yeah. Yeah, sure. And I think that.

The way to look at this is like.

When you look at cloud, you know inherently there's a general

feeling that OK, what's the security of cloud? Is my data

safe? Is my infrastructure safe? What are the, what are the pros

and cons of it? I would say you'll have to take a, you know,

you'll have to take a calculated approach for the as you look at

the cloud. For example, in the Ukraine situation, right if if

the attacks were on physical data centers and there were no

backups, so there was no apps, services that were running in

the cloud.

Uh, data centers that were physically there in the in a

specific location, if they were under attack through through a

physical warfare mechanism that would also render the digital

services you know to be not available and that would become

another. You know that the direct attack on the technology

infrastructure. But at the same time if you have a backup or if

you have your disaster recovery or your Dr. plan running in the

cloud and as you know cloud service providers, the data

centers, the regions, the.

The all of this is not known in in you know in the in the public

domain so in a way you can you know it also enables you to have

either ADR or an availability zone and and creates still a

backup for your whether it's critical infrastructure or

whether it is for this business applications. I would say

depending on how you look at risk and how you want to

mitigate it. Cloud can be a primary option. Cloud can be a

backup.

Option cloud can be a hybrid option. Now come into the second

concern which is generally they're saying OK while I look

at cloud as as my secure as my alternative for my physical data

center and to address the availability issues. How can I

you know trust cloud and this cloud safe? And is is my data

secure? I think Azure service provider for example at

Microsoft.

We definitely do a lot of knowledge sharing, do a lot of

yeah, I would say visibility into how Microsoft secures cloud

and not just like by sharing information, but also

participating and enlisting ourselves for third party

audits, certifications like for example the Microsoft Cloud is

part of the mighty empanelment, right? So.

The cloud service provider. So I think it's it's also not just

being being sharing of knowledge but also getting sort of tied

and and you know being audited and sharing how you know the

cloud is safe and secure and building that element of trust.

So I think it's it's it's a two way St. sharing of knowledge

sharing of information showing how what are the steps that a

cloud service provider like Microsoft is taking to ensure

the security of the digital goods as well as the physical

goods.

In their in their data center and creating more like a hybrid

approach to an organization in case they were physically under

attack or even digitally under attack in case of a ransomware

situation.

Thank you.

Mr. ministry.

Would want to get your views. You know we have been discussing

on enhancing India's cyber laws and you know there was some work

which was done particularly with respect to making changes in the

Indian IT act. We saw the certain rules come in. However,

what we see so far is that.

Be healthcare ecosystem, not just healthcare but the entire

ecosystem which includes pharmacy which holds so much

amount of our PII personal identifiable information if

they.

Lose the data.

There is no liability, there's no penalty. Most of the chief

information security officers which who have been appointed

have been appointed keeping in global regulations and not India

regulations per se. And we also see a heavy use of IoT based

systems. We see heavy use of AI also. They are AI enabled

systems which are being used, chat bots being put up, so

overall.

Taking learnings from the aims attack, Rob, what are some of

the things that Government of India could do to enhance the

safety and security of the health care ecosystem in India?

Thank you, kanishk.

First of all.

Let me convey that.

In respect of the existing IT act.

There are.

Two sections which exclusively deal with the cyber security

aspects.

One of in fact, two of them are with respect to creation of the

specialized institutions, particularly the computer

emergency response team.

Indian Computer Emergency Response team as well as NCIC

for critical infrastructure.

There is Section 70 also I mean which.

In addition to I mean creating these two infrastructure, I mean

which which provides for declaration of a critical.

Information infrastructure.

To be.

Notified and once notified it is called as protected system.

And the whole idea of notification.

Is that one the organization?

Carries out a detailed risk analysis of what exactly is

critical with them.

And.

Critical here means unavailability of which will

have a impact.

At a national level.

Either in terms of economy or in terms of public health.

Or there is one more term. Maybe I'm not, not immediately. I'm in

getting it, but the impact is at a national level.

And to that an extent, NCC not only I mean works for

identifying the critical information infrastructure, it

also works for.

Identifying critical.

Sectors.

And particularly post COVID health sector has already been

identified as a critical sector.

And as of today, if you look at.

Almost every week we are notifying one or other.

Identified infrastructure as the critical in, I mean as as the

protected system, so being notified as protected systems

so. So that's one.

2nd is.

Of course from Government of India side.

There had always been a.

A constant effort. The Cisos are appointed in all government

organizations and the intent is not that it is. It has to be

with respect to all government organizations. In fact, if you

look at the the other part of the IT Act, which is primarily

about Section 43A.

Which deals with sensitive personal data or information and

protection of sensitive data, personal data or information. It

also talks about anybody corporate which is which is

processing.

The sensitive personal data in any way.

And when I say processing means, I mean in the entire lifecycle

of the data is starting from collection to storage to

processing to analyze to to maybe finally.

Archiving and disposal.

The the body corporate is mandated.

To ensure a reasonable degree of security.

And if I look at the spdi rules, which not only mandate the

existence of a privacy policy, but also mention that in order

to to to ensure and in order to demonstrate that the

organization is doing the reasonable or is following the

reasonable security practices.

It recommends that the organization should comply with

ISO 27,001.

Which means a good information security management system

should be in place.

So while for example certain already uh, I mean it comes out

with day-to-day vulnerability notes with day-to-day

advisories, it provided a comprehensive set of directions

on 28th of April 2022.

And one of the learning that we had.

Based on the IMS incident, is that maybe?

While while we are talking of having the, I mean the CISOS in

every government organizations, while we are asking every

government organization to have a.

Business continuity plan?

Certain is coming out.

Shortly with a detailed guideline.

In respect of of course, all government organizations and

technically, I mean actually it will mean for all, all

organizations in the country as to what kind of controls.

Should be in place whether they are technical, whether they are

organizational or whether they are process oriented. So, so

detailed guidelines are being worked out and shall be out

shortly. I mean from from certain perspective.

I would also like to say, I mean going beyond what is stated in

the law, I would also like to say that.

From uh in order to have, I should say, secure products in

place.

As TQC, which is also part of Ministry of Information and I

Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, SQC

Directorate is already working on and is the national body for

the common criteria certification.

I'm sure about 20 different products have already been

tested and certified by them.

To qualify.

At different, I should say uh, assessment level.

As the CC certified products.

The country needs more and more such capability in the country.

And to that an extent, we also have, uh, software.

I mean, we also have an empanelment scheme for software

testing laboratories. So it's not just about the products

which need to be tested, but we also need to have the

laboratories, reasonably good number of laboratories to be

able to test such products in India.

And on both these accounts SQC is already working. So I'll say

that.

1.

The existing IT law already has certain provisions.

2.

The The government already have, I should say, a well defined

structure and well recognized internationally well recognized

structure in place.

Three, almost every government organization, I mean so. So

while security is required by everybody, of course, I mean

being in government, our domain is primarily to is to also

ensure that government organizations remain secure and

to that an extent, whatever is necessary for government

organizations to be secure, proactive measures are being

taken.

So.

From a from a policy perspective, these things are

already in place and in the new Digital India Act that we are

talking of a comprehensive view of.

What the security structure? I mean security policy of the

organizations, I mean of the country should be.

Including maybe possibilities of having.

More sectoral and state level certs.

Coordination between these sectoral and state level certs.

Visive is the national cert.

Ability to create standards in the area of cybersecurity.

And ability to test.

Cyber security products and systems.

Is being envisaged so.

These are some of the initiatives in the existing and

the potential IT act and the and from the government side.

Thank you, Mr. Maheshwari. So we also have yeah, Doctor Debra,

please go ahead. I just have a humble request to our honorable

speaker that ISO 27001 is a very good regulation to be

implemented and to it is a process oriented kind of

implementation in the healthcare system. If we have implemented

227799 which is actually been designed for to take care of the

health data that could be an very good Sir.

So so.

In addition to isms, because ISS today, if you look at the

development of ISO 27,001 and related standards, in fact,

security and privacy.

Or or lower security and data protection for that reason are

merging.

There is a convergence of these two things.

So from once again from government perspective.

Government is already working on the digital data protection

bill.

And if things go well, very soon, the the we we already had

gone in for public consultation of the DP, DP bill, which was on

November 2022.

Hopefully in time to come you will see the bill going to the

Parliament there after of course it's the call of the Parliament

to be to be able to take, but I do agree that 27,001 remains a

generic standard.

Has to be supplemented by the sector sector specific

requirements.

Though it is a process standard, it does talk of it does talk of

understanding the risks of the corresponding I mean industry.

Corresponding or organization and based on which.

Whatever is considered to be necessary control.

Not just process, but also people. Also technology. So it

it, it's a it's a convergence of all three.

This one slide slide down, you spoke about the certain

guidelines coming for organizations. Will this be

subject to a minimum number that the organization organization

should be of particular size or will it be a blanket for all

organizations?

That's a that's a perennial problem. No, no, I mean see

something which is like.

What certain issue last year was a direction?

And direction means it's it was applicable to almost every

organization the respective of the size. And by the way, in

cyber security size does not matter.

Even a small IoT and a vulnerability in a small IoT can

impact and a very, I should say low cost product can lead to

whatever level of disaster you can think of.

So, so guidelines for that reason or even if say I I need

to talk via so 27,001 it all depends upon the nature of the

risks that you have.

Therefore, what is your past? What is your likely future?

In which environment are you working?

How critical is the business?

And to that an extent.

There is no prescriptive, I should say, language of what

controls need to be in place. It is for the organizations to take

call of how much is necessary.

In respect of that particular organization and that particular

ecosystem.

I think more than employees, the amount of data that anyone is

managing that.

Could give us a hint of risk. For example, when WhatsApp was

acquired, they had only 50 employees, but they were

managing 450 million users.

So.

Just having employees count will not help anyways, completely

agreeing. So, so nowadays all these startups, they have few

guys, but they are actually managing data of completely

aliens and millions of people. Employees therefore means

internal risks, yeah, but at the end of the day, number of

customers means businesses exactly that kind of risk that

you potentially can help. But it's I think what Ganesh can

Pankaj were trying to bring out is that smaller organizations

should be able to afford the kind of security that we are

talking about.

Uh and uh, I'm just trying to understand how will we be able

to.

Enable smaller organizations to have the funds, which to them

may not appear to be very good ROI on the face of it, but

actually when when it comes to reality, it isn't. There is a

hidden ROI in it.

Uh, but a smaller organization doesn't see it so, at least in

the initial stages. So vulnerabilities are inherent in

smaller organizations. And how is it that they can be enabled,

at times forced and yet enabled?

Like.

Which are foundation should be able to help.

Unfortunately there is no shortcut.

Unfortunately there is no shortcut and business being a

small does not mean that the the issues may be small.

I completely agree. I mean where the focus should be and how much

should be the focus, that depends upon what kind of risks

are you willing to take it up. So. So once again, I mean say

for example, certain has come out with these directions, but

how many of them have really implemented in letter and

spirit?

It is more of, I should say, a business, uh, finally a business

call.

At the end of the day.

Good regulation, bad regulation. But once again matters is an

enforcement and enforcement is something which I do believe. I

mean an organization like Cert.

Particularly chasing people to or or maybe seeing proactive

implementation will always be a tough task.

But the fact remains.

That once these directions have been issued.

Once the intent has been conveyed.

It is very clear that the business of cyber security or or

whichever business you are in, cyber security has to be taken

seriously. Now. How serious you are able to take, understand and

implement this is a matter of time.

Thank you, uh want to bring in Salil Mithil uh Saul had cyber

security for Reliance Jio Infocom welcome cell. So until

you have been managing you know.

Multiple cybersecurity compliances and audits for

Reliance Geo. And you know Geo is obviously national critical

information infrastructure, you know, regulated organization as

a CI. So what really changes once an organization becomes a

CII? Do you have more audits or is it more of checklist based

audits or you need to build out proactive controls?

For safeguarding against cyber attacks and what is the

effectiveness of such audits, do the radio help you again, cyber

attacks? Because I think the complexity of Geo is they would

face the most complex cyber attacks given the mix of data,

telecom services which they have and the plethora of apps which

are being provided through the Geo marketplace. So over to you.

Thank you. Thanks Ganesh for inviting me first of all.

So what's our was saying, I completely agree that the size

doesn't matter and this cyberspace and especially you

know when when you are dealing sensitive information like

health et cetera, which is SPI.

Coming to the CIA, uh, you know, part, you know, it's a very

interesting journey that we took almost like uh four years back

when the discussion started. And you know, I think industry at

large all all welcomed the concept of CII almost five years

back when we started with identification of CIIS and what

will be the what, what can be defined as PII. But that journey

itself was pretty interesting.

And now we have at least some telecommunication, a clearly

identified CI. You see what happens is it brings.

A certain amount of seriousness within.

You know, because ultimately you know that, um.

That that there is a system that you are holding which is of

national interest, right, that that brings a lot of, you know

of course focus and ensuring security and controls. But you

know, what I feel is more of a difference. You know it more of

you know because things are already, you know, for example,

tech oriented companies are doing a lot of cybersecurity

investments and taking initiatives, but it does bring.

More focused from the leadership and it certainly have a strong,

uh, you know, it acts like a deterrence. So I feel that.

Identifying scoping out CI is is very very important and is the

most critical time which we at least as industry we took a

couple of years all of us as a you know and with the dot we

took some time but it has its own benefits and to to your

question of audits you know let me tell you cybersecurity has

gone beyond audits now so you know audits are.

Um, you know, nobody actually cares about audit. We are

actually facing serious issues and compliances.

You know, we don't need a regulator or a external

instructor to come and tell us that you do it. It's a

necessity. It's a necessity of the time and the more we are

growing.

You know if you don't do it.

We will not have, uh, you know, things that we want to do. So

it's like, you know, it's a matter of.

I would say do or die kind of a situation. So. So that's how I

see and CI is something which you know at least at my personal

level I have pretty much appreciated the journey and we

are interacting closely with with agencies and they certainly

value it and it's a pretty positive move.

Thank you, Sir, with respect to you know.

Lot of vendors and 3rd party ecosystem providers, how does

the journey change for them? Because I think the main part is

also the suppliers where most of the risk originate from. Today

we are third party 4th party suppliers and I'll also add ask

Doctor Debu to come in on this because I think from the

organization where he is or where he was earlier, there was

a lot of compliance which used to come to them as part of NCI

PCC.

Sorry. So should I? Yeah, go ahead, go ahead. OK. You see, it

is the entire, you know, the fraternity, or I would say the

entire ecosystem is maturing.

So with let's say.

You know, we just talked spoke about IT and when when Sir was

talking about you know, how to device, I was thinking about the

Mirai attack that happened in 2016.

In fact, that was a small core written by uh, a student, right,

which brought down almost like 30% of the Internet by just

impacting DNS. So. So that's the power of IoT which impacted all

the, you know, routers, webcams, etc etc. So.

So now with with learning was humongous, you know what I can

do because now we're not talking about millions of devices but

billions and trillions and the number the, the explosion of

devices is happening as we are moving forward. So we have seen

a lot of maturity and a lot of you know secure security

frameworks being designed for irrated systems, right similarly

you know the manufacturers, the suppliers.

You know, they are also bringing that seriousness. So there is

certainly an uplift and at least I can tell you from the

regulatory perspective that now there is a national trusted

devices portal that is there now vendors are being asked to

register their devices and there is an entire process of

formulation of that trust. And GSMA, there's another agency

that works closely with telecom is coming up with those.

You know for certifications and exist. So I would say that the

the entire ecosystem is, is improving and there is a you

know and and that that is the need of the hour. So I would say

that we are certainly moving, but is the speed right, maybe,

maybe not. Do we need to do more? Certainly yes. So that's

how it is. But things are facing up, it's moving in the right

direction.

Thank you, Doctor Devi. Yeah, just correlating what actually

we are doing in telecom space since I came from telecom

background. So basically what when we do the SLA agreement

with our third party vendors, we do tell them to do the MBSS

minimum security baseline checks and do the minimum hygiene check

which has been formulated by dot see you will find out there are

a lot of good regulations has been formulated by our

Government of India but.

To be very honest, they spoke less, but they've done very

great work. If you see in the telecom sectors, they have been

given a very good articulated how the MBS has need to be

implemented. When I say MBS has what actually it contains, it

contains basically the password management and the password

management is very, very critical and also it represents

what are the various kinds of user access management policies

that need to be implemented when we lease out to a very huge

amount of network.

Then you must kept the users. Who are the users coming to the

network, what time they are logging into the network, what

are the activities they're doing, what are the commands

they are firing and that commands is doing in terms of

whatever various kinds of work, is it a legitimate users that is

doing it. So in that context also you will find out telecom

networks rounds with a lot of operating systems, it will runs

with a lot of various kinds of systems which are also inbuilt.

That means there are.

Proprietary vendors, those have inbuilt operating systems. So

the patch management system plays a very important role to

do the patch management system. You cannot do it by single going

to each and every system and do the patch management. So we have

to implement the configuration management system and automate

it. The moment you will automate the configuration management

system, the patch will be immediately pushed from the

center central server to the various nodes and it will be

periodically updated.

Similarly you will find out I'll just your ad audit is a very,

very essential part of any kind of network because all these

things will be drafted in the SLA with our third party which

are we are outsourcing to them. But we have to check with a

thorough audit. So moment if we do not do audit then you cannot

find out what are the things, what are the SLA. They have been

have agreement with us whether they are following those

exercises, what extent they're following the.

SLS. So that is why the very essential part is to do the

audit. So that's why I also give a lead auditor course and there

have been certified ISO lead auditors which has been goes and

deep into the systems process, people, technology, what Sarah

told. And then they will find out whether it has been

implemented in the system or not. And then you will find out

what extent it has been implemented, what extent the

SLA, because in the telecom network we have to keep the SLA

99.9.

So that way actually we have to go very thorough in detail to

understand how actually audit plays a very important role in

this era.

Thank you.

There's no way, sweetie. If we have to build out minimum

baseline security standards for healthcare ecosystem healthcare,

where do we start?

Who would be the organization?

That would have the mandate.



And you have to ensure audit happens or compliance happens.

See that irrespective of any sector, including the health

sector.

You know, the baseline standard I always recommend is ISO 27,001

coupled with.

The guidelines which is ISO 7 which is 27, ISO 27,002.

They can always be looked into.

We are not saying that going for certification of ISO 27,001, but

definitely any industry for that reason must have a look at.

This particular standard.

Coupled with of course the the.

Concerned sectoral.

Technical standards.

Which for which guidance can always be taken, maybe from the

bias the ISO standards, maybe from the sectoral industry

standards, from the NIST standards?

But.

I SMS.

ISO 27,001 based ISS.

Can always be considered as a baseline standard to be

followed.

Thank you.

Amit, you know you've been part of a lot of such.

Activities on compliances.

When it comes to the actual situation, which happens on

ground, say the aims attack, you know, we heard that aims already

had some amount of assessments and audits done. In fact, one of

the big fours was appointed as their cybersecurity auditors and

they did finish an assessment, but there were still aspects

which were left open. So where do you think are some of the

gaps that need to be addressed? Is it on the audit side? Is it

on the patch management side?

Is it more on the real time monitoring?

First of all, this is the big learning from the aims attack

that even if you are doing regular audit, that doesn't

assure you that you will not have any such attack.

So there were regular audits for sure by one of the big fours.

We had that audit report.

There were some findings.

Some of these findings were fixed. Some of these findings

were not fixed.

So another learning is yes, we do not take these audit reports

seriously, we think.

Even if you are OK with 50% of findings to be fixed, it's OK

even if there is one such vulnerabilities left unpatched.

I think that.

Could damage you.

The way we have seen.

So 41357, which was focused more on e-mail server

vulnerabilities, in this case I think uh, leftover and.

That was their life for two months.

In the system. So I think this is another learning 3rd as you

have said rightly.

Uh.

That this industry itself is not matured for with the with the

mindset problem, they don't they they think that healthcare

sectors will never be attacked or if even if it is attacked.

Uh.

What?

The attacker could gain out of it.

So I think this mindset should be changed. Now we see the value

of this data and this can be used. So if I see that most of

these healthcare systems were attacked even Biocon or whatever

we have seen.

The criminal was interested to challenge the confidentiality or

availability.

We have never observed any integrity challenge yet.

But that doesn't mean it has not happened. Actually it has

happened that is happening, but we can't see the repercussions

of that because it is a back door. It is changing something.

People are not aware of it.

And by the time you realize that this damage has happened, it is

too late.

But if the system is down or if the data is out, I think that is

something which we clearly see and we react to that.

So this is another problem.

I'm sure that the criminals are trying all of these three attack

vectors to challenge confidentiality, integrity and

availability. And 3rd, as you said, rightly said that third

party.

Associations those are there with these health sectors

including logistics, including other manner this medicine

supply companies and all. They are also not secure so the

thread could come from anywhere.

We don't have a process in place to put guidelines on 3rd party

vendors.

And to assure them, even if we hack a third party vendor who's

been communicating on e-mail.

And.

This third party vendor is not having a secure e-mail server.

You could send an e-mail from his e-mail server to the aims

e-mail. They would open it, they will they will try to follow

that if there is a bill attached to it or there is any invoice

attached to it. So this is something which is which I see

that the possibilities are enormous. It's very easy to

create such kind of challenges for these systems because of

this missing policies and missing systems especially

depending on so many.

Vendors. Those are communicating directly with their authorities.

So there should be hierarchical ways of communications

segregation of data. As far as said, we cannot treat all data

equally.

The OPD data, the the, the, the, the diagnostics data, the

vendors data and then finished data and also there are

different healthcare system itself is a big industry so it

has all, all all kind of informations.

And we should classify it first and then depending on the risk

associated to that data we should apply the mechanisms.

I think that is missing right now and that segregation is must

which Government of India in their data privacy, but I think

they'll classify all this.

Thank you. To something which I think few of my inputs. Sure.

Uh, teju, deep uh. I think you come from the healthcare

industry. We want to get in your points here. I think you wanted

to share your thoughts. Yeah, thanks. You can unmute yourself

to HD.

We are. You're new to tasty.

I so sorry. So my name is deep and I'm working with Fortis and

I've recently launched a new unit in Greater Noida.

And the assessment of aims cyber attack comes very important and

close to us because we deal with every day out. However, the one

critical aspect of learning was in network segmentation.

Which was not properly done.

Look at aims and it is not just with aims, it's with everybody,

but at the end, I mean we always look at, you know, vendors, we

always look at Slas, we always look at the Sops, we always look

at the audit, but we always misses the social engineering

part.

You know, somebody wanted to get in and they got in irrespective

of all the, you know, firewalls with all the technology in

place, but they still got in even after the audit.

So not only does the technological.

Check.

Takes any precedence, but also the human check also takes equal

precedence, and that is where we always try to ensure that the

social engineering component of the human error is.

Not exploited. So that's my two cents on this.

Thank you, Tep Smita, you know you've been hearing us, you

know, recently. You know, you've written a.

A book on IoT, right? And IoT has huge ramification when it

comes to healthcare sector. We've spoken on network

segmentations but when we are working on connected.

Cyber and Physical Systems, network segmentations, uh is

just one part. What? What are some of the other best practices

you think are important?

Hey, yeah. Thanks for having me here. Uh, see, uh, one very

important aspect when we are talking about, uh, national

critical infrastructure, specifically when we are dealing

with such a sensitive content.

Doing all this integration of those intelligence from the

devices. Hope I'm audible there.

Yes, yes, you are. Please go ahead.

So first, first and foremost is like say collecting all those

signals from various uh components because we are

talking about like say robots or say we are talking about all

those devices which are sending signals or say Internet enabled

devices which are like say continuously having those feeds.

It is very, very important that when we are putting such systems

in place, convergence is obviously one good thing. But at

the same time are we encrypting the data when it is passing

through?

Different places. So we were talking about like say I was

hearing this panel here and they were also talking about this

encryption. It is very very important that not only storing

this data, storing it safe but at the same time are we

encrypting it with enough strain so that the data even if it goes

out or say it is being exchanged for a legitimate purpose at both

the places, so data at rest and data in motion both the places

it is safe.

And uh, when we are talking about this critical

infrastructure UH-11 more thing which is generally means like

say ignore when people say that OK they are totally isolated it

and OT they're isolated there is firewall. And actually when we

go and check the reality is totally different.

They are having that USB or say pen drive which is being

inserted in those critical infrastructure or says servers

or engineering workstations for updates or sometime given access

through Internet directly to upgrade the system.

So that that defeats the purpose of creating those kind of

network segmentation, right? Because you're directly exposing

those devices without appropriate controls. So

built-in control is another thing which one should look

very, very carefully.

Because the way it used to be a problem in it, now most of the

people are saying that whether it be it cloud or say be on

Prem, all the infrastructure should have built in security.

We are yet to see that maturity in IoT systems.

Back to you connect. Thank you, smita. I think we're coming

towards the end of the session, so now would want to get in last

closing thoughts from everybody.

Maheshwari.

Uh.

I would just like to mention that security is everybody's

responsibility.

The need for cyber security will continue to evolve, and to that

an extent.

Organization should continue to invest not only in terms of

technical controls, but also in terms of.

Educating people.

Their own employees, and that's a ongoing and a continuous

process.

Thank you.

Michael and yeah, uh, I think my, my thought on this is that,

uh, we need to develop not only systems, but we have to get

self-reliant with the kind of requirements or hardware

requirements which are there. A lot of work is already probably

going into it. We hear a lot about chips now hopefully going

to get manufactured in India. We need to have our own cloud. So

we need to create our own systems and we need to do it

super fast.

So the amount of priority that needs to be put into this,

whether it's healthcare or other sectors, I think it's a very,

very high priority sector now.

Thank you, doctor Debu.

So I will say, uh, like we have a HIPAA regulation which is

basically used for healthcare systems. We need to have some

kind of regulation in India which will create that baseline

and based on this we will find out how it will be basically

catered to those systems. And since medical will be very much

depends on the in future you will be on robotic surgeries and

to understand the robotic surgeries if very prominent.

Person needs are going under surgery and then you will find

out the operating algorithms or artificial intelligence

algorithms, machine learning algorithms, if they are not

behaving transparently, ethically and then that will

create havoc. So we must be very sensitive. Even one human life

cause will be an essence loss. So because because of this.

Kind of thing. So that's why uh, maybe you can segregate if we

have the, we have a prominent person going into that kind of

thing. So that's why bringing a HIPAA kind of regulation and

embedding all these technologies as technology. When you bring

the regulation of course you cannot point out a technology

because technology agnostic regulation you need to have to

be brought and based on this you have to like the US, UK.

And the European Union they're bringing and that way actually

we have to see how actually we can brought a regulation and

that will cater to the next generation and the next

generation you will find out will be helpful if we brought a

specific medical kind of devices regulated by a robust regulation

mechanism.

Thank you, smita. Your thoughts in terms of what we can do more?

Sure, sure. So one thing is very, uh, uh, good or say when

we are sitting here together, it is a private and public

partnership where we say that, OK, we know three things are

needed, people, process and technology, all three together.

We have to bond to bring this change which we are speaking

about. All these things has to be in place. The right

technology, the right people and the processes obviously will

help us to navigate this situation.

Where we are today and it is very, very important that we

pull these things together and and create such a bond or say

that Community where we talk and we we create that that connect.

So back to your kanesh.

Thank you, Samuel. Thank you, smita. This is very helpful.

Salil.

See, I was, uh, you know, I remembered in 2017, I guess

about company recalled almost like 4,00,000 or five Lac

pacemakers because they were vulnerable to cyber patches,

right. And in the vicinity somebody can do some, you know,

manipulation in terms of even a skip of heartbeat was possible.

It happened in 2017 I guess.

What I foresee probably is being a tech enthusiast that what

Fintech has seen, what Edtech has seen, what other you know,

industry verticals are seeing as a, as a, you know similarly

health, health track is is coming up right. We have such

intelligent devices coming up and this will with the amount of

you know hail surveillance or you know diseases that are

coming up the health sector will take.

A major, you know in times to come maybe in the near future.

So you know because of IoT, 5G etcetera, etcetera. So the the

impact of this sector is humongous and it adds the

element of you know health and safety into cyber. So just not

confidentiality, integrity and availability, but it's a matter

of you know maybe life and death. So that's serious this

industry would be and the.

The appliances and applications so.

We all have to bridge it up and bring all our learnings,

capability building what our speaker has said, you know that

we have to bring in House capability and that's that's how

we'll be able to sail through this, this thing.

Thank you, Technip. Penny, you know, closing remarks from you.

Umm.

So I would just add on to what Salil said that you know, what

we learned from the health, Fintech and other technology

aspects, you know, harm in other industries are more of monetary.

You know, but when it comes to health tech, the harm is life

itself.

And, you know, we look at life day in, day out and you know,

the only happiness which a hospital or a health environment

provides is probably a birthing experience. But apart from that,

everything is about, you know, loss for recovery.

So I think anybody is going to work in the health tech or the

healthcare department in the technology or the IT or I, you

know, information technology, the last headache he wants is to

be blamed.

For the death of someone because a virus got through.

So I think seriousness at all levels of policymaking should

address that.

That you know, somebody can hack into somebody near and dear ones

pacemaker.

And cause an undamaged causes severe damage without the poor

guy you know, not even knowing it. Then being involved as a

leverage for some great policymaking because some hacker

somewhere has a hold on your father's or your brothers or

your own pacemaker.

Absolutely. That's it. Thanks. Thanks, Daisy. Amit.

I have. I have a take on like we all were.

Concern for the situation when these attacks will become so

sophisticated that they can take some life. What if they are

already taking?

Life and we don't know.

Did we do any such investigation research. So that is my bigger

concern that if it is already happening and we are not

noticing it and there are people that are taking advantage of

such ignorance because we are not focusing. OK, every day

people are dying. So So what if two more people?

Are added in that list. So I think this is something which we

should take very very seriously and it should not be just an

assumption that it will happen. I'm sure if it will happen, it

is happening.

It is happening in round the corners second.

They're also taking quantum very lightly. So we need to move from

secure to quantum safe very soon, very very fast. That is my

another request to all these sectors. And 3rd there are also

non IT components, so we always think that component those are

connected to Internet. This could only be the entry points

to such attacks. No it is there are RF attacks directly that can

happen through these devices and if you just.

Do a little research, you will find there are cases registered

reported worldwide where RF attack happened and they they

took life. So I think especially for healthcare sector, we should

also consider security for these kind of attack vectors. So these

are a few of my inputs for today's as a conclusive remark.

Thank you.

Thank you everyone.

With this, we come now towards the, uh, you know, end of the

session. So I'd like to thank our honorable speakers, Mr.

Maheshwari, Major Bananan Salil Mittal.

Terrence Gomes, uh Smita Jain, Dr. Debu Nayak.

Satish Deep Singh Randhawa and Kapil Madan.

Who joined us?

Amit dubey.

And Pankaj, uh, we'll take all the inputs and we'll be

submitting our recommendations to the office of the National

Cyber Security Coordinator, NCI, PCC and to Ministry of

Electronics Information Technology on what are some of

the steps that could be taken into consideration and when CERT

is coming out. With this new guidelines, what could be done

particularly to look at the healthcare ecosystem attacks

which are in place, right. Thank you everyone who joined us

virtually and in physically in person we'll now.

End the session. Look forward to keeping in touch with you. We'll

reach out to you for specific inputs for our White Paper and.

A report which we will be creating as part of this

consultation. Thank you so much.

Thank you, everyone. Take care. Thank you, thank you, thank you,

thank you. Thank you.

Thanks for that. Thanks. So thanks everyone.

Thank you. No, actually we can't have tea, but I request everyone

to enjoy their yeah high T and snacks. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks,

manmeet. Alright, thank you. Bye, bye. Thank you.
